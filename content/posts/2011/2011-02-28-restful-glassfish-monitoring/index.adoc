= RESTful GlassFish Monitoring
Jason Lee
2011-02-28

In previous posts, I've shown various ways to manage a GlassFish 3.1 server via its REST interface.  As nice as that is, we also support monitoring your server via REST as well.  In this article, we'll take a look at some of the things you can ask of your server.

If you're familiar with the management interface, you should be immediately comfortable with the monitoring interface.  To access it, you use http://localhost:4848/monitoring/domain[http://localhost:4848/monitoring/domain].  Just like the management interface, you can request HTML, XML, or JSON.  The simplest way to change the return type is to append an extension of the desired type.
[source,bash,linenums]
----
$ curl http://localhost:4848/monitoring/domain.html
$ curl http://localhost:4848/monitoring/domain.xml
$ curl http://localhost:4848/monitoring/domain.json
----

Similarly, you can use the `Accept` header as well:

[source,bash,linenums]
----
$ curl -H "Accept: text/html" http://localhost:4848/monitoring/domain
$ curl -H "Accept: application/xml" http://localhost:4848/monitoring/domain
$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:4848/monitoring/domain
----

There's a good chance that at this point, many of you are getting a response that looks like this (in JSON):
[source,js,linenums]
----
{
    "message": "",
    "command": "Monitoring Data",
    "exit_code": "SUCCESS"
}
----

I'll admit that's not a very helpful message, but the issue here is that while monitoring is turned on by default, the monitoring levels are set to `OFF` by default.  You can change that a few different ways.  Perhaps the two easiest are via the command-line (you can use `asadmin set`, but we'll not look at that here):

[source,bash,linenums]
----
...
----

or via the Admin Console:

Select the modules you're interested in (if you're just experimenting, it might be best to select all of them), select the level you want (again, I'd suggest `HIGH` for now), then click save.  Your monitoring requests will now give you the data you're seeking.

Now that we know _how_ to get the data, what _kind_ of data can get?  Fortunately, the system will help you with that:

[source,bash,linenums]
----
$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:4848/monitoring/domain
{
    "message": "",
    "command": "Monitoring Data",
    "exit_code": "SUCCESS",
    "extraProperties": {
        "entity": {},
        "childResources": {"server": "http:\/\/localhost:4848\/monitoring\/domain\/server"}
    }
}
----

If you just installed GlassFish 3.1, you'll see the above.  If, however, you have a more complex setup (cluster, standalone instances, etc.), you might see something like this (two clustered instances, one standalone instance,  and the DAS):

[source,bash,linenums]
----
$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:4848/monitoring/domain
{
    "message": "",
    "command": "Monitoring Data",
    "exit_code": "SUCCESS",
    "extraProperties": {
        "entity": {},
        "childResources": {
            "c1in1": "http:\/\/localhost:4848\/monitoring\/domain\/c1in1",
            "c1in2": "http:\/\/localhost:4848\/monitoring\/domain\/c1in2",
            "in1": "http:\/\/localhost:4848\/monitoring\/domain\/in1",
            "server": "http:\/\/localhost:4848\/monitoring\/domain\/server"
        }
    }
}
----

If you do have extra instances like this, you will need to set the monitoring levels as desired in the appropriate configuration.

The `server` instance (also known as the DAS), has these child elements:

[source,bash,linenums]
----
$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:4848/monitoring/domain/server
{
    "message": "",
    "command": "Monitoring Data",
    "exit_code": "SUCCESS",
    "extraProperties": {
        "entity": {
            "starttime": "1298837779434",
            "state": "1",
            "uptime": "2639132"
        },
        "childResources": {
            "applications": "http:\/\/localhost:4848\/monitoring\/domain\/server\/applications",
            "deployment": "http:\/\/localhost:4848\/monitoring\/domain\/server\/deployment",
            "http-service": "http:\/\/localhost:4848\/monitoring\/domain\/server\/http-service",
            "jvm": "http:\/\/localhost:4848\/monitoring\/domain\/server\/jvm",
            "network": "http:\/\/localhost:4848\/monitoring\/domain\/server\/network",
            "resources": "http:\/\/localhost:4848\/monitoring\/domain\/server\/resources",
            "security": "http:\/\/localhost:4848\/monitoring\/domain\/server\/security",
            "transaction-service": "http:\/\/localhost:4848\/monitoring\/domain\/server\/transaction-service",
            "web": "http:\/\/localhost:4848\/monitoring\/domain\/server\/web"
        }
    }
}
----

Note that we can see the server start time (displayed in Unix time. This server was started on Sun Feb 27 2011 14:16:19 GMT-0600 (CST)) and how long the server has been up (2639132 milliseconds, or about 44 minutes).  Notice under `childResources` the various classes of additional information.  The easiest way to examine those is to point your browser at http://localhost:4848/monitoring/domain/server[].  Go ahead and poke around. You can't hurt anything. : )

While I won't take the time to examine the tree exhaustively, for those that can't examine a running GlassFish instance right now, let's take a look at the information on memory the server gives us:

[source,bash,linenums]

$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:4848/monitoring/domain/server/jvm/memory

In English, this shows us:

* CommittedHeapSize - 158642176 bytes
* CommittedNonHeapSize - 120938496 bytes
* InitialHeapSize - 0 bytes
* InitialNonHeapSize - 12750848 bytes
* MaxHeapSize - 518979584 bytes
* MaxNonHeapSize - 234881024 bytes
* ObjectsPendingFinalization - 0
* UsedHeapSize - 95092688 bytes
* UsedNonHeapSize - 77427208 bytes

Similarly, from http://localhost:4848/monitoring/domain/server/jvm/runtime[], we learn (large strings like `InputArguments` stripped for brevity's sake):

* ClassPath
* InputArguments
* LibraryPath
* ManagementSpecVersion - 1.2
* Name - 937@halpert
* SpecName - Java Virtual Machine Specification
* SpecVendor - Sun Microsystems Inc.
* SpecVersion - 1.0
* Uptime - 1298843595776
* VmName - Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM
* VMVendor - Apple Inc.
* VmVersion - 17.1-b03-307

We've only scratched the surface of what the monitoring interface can provide developers and administrators, and since this is REST, you no longer need to write a Java client to get to the data, so point your browser at the monitoring interface and start digging.
