= Sandbox Demo and Nightlies Available
Jason Lee
2007-02-23

Thanks to the generosity of http://blogs.sun.com/rlubke/[Ryan Lubke], http://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/[Ed Burns] and the http://javaserver.org/[javaserver.org] folks, the Sandbox demo application, which can be http://fisheye5.cenqua.com/browse/javaserverfaces-sources/contrib/sandbox/demo[found] in the Sandbox source http://fisheye5.cenqua.com/browse/javaserverfaces-sources/contrib/sandbox/[tree], is now available http://javaserver.org/JsfRiSandboxDemo/[online].  There are a couple of known issues with it, but it should give you a good sense of the current state of the components.

We also have nightly snapshots of the sandbox source, binaries and demo https://javaserverfaces.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=6512&expandFolder=6512&folderID=0[available] on the RI website.  If you find any issues, please file an issue on the <a  href="https://javaserverfaces.dev.java.net/issues/enter_bug.cgi?subcomponent=sandbox&version=current">tracker</a>.
