I recently found myself writing a test that needed a database. Unfortunately, our testing database,
https://h2database.com[H2], doesn't support all of the features of our production database,
https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL]. This meant that the
https://flywaydb.org/[Flyway] migrates used to manage the production database broke in the testing environment. The fix for
this turned out to be pretty simple.

To set the scenario, imagine you have this table:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE foo (
    id bigint PRIMARY KEY,
    some_json JSONB
);
----

The only thing interesting about this table is the `jsonb` column, but it's that column that breaks
when run under https://h2database.com[H2]:

----
SQL Error [50004] [HY004]: Unknown data type: "JSONB"
----

The fix is a simple one-liner:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE domain IF NOT EXISTS jsonb AS character varying (8192);
----

In my case, I added that to a https://flywaydb.org/[Flyway] migrate file, named in such a way that it ran before the problematic
`CREATE TABLE` statement, and Bob's...uhhh.. _my_ uncle! :)

Hope that helps!
