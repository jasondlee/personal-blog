= Fairwell, Wordpress!

Last summer, I put up a quick entry about link:/posts/2012/07/16/a-new-way-to-blog/[a new way to blog], which I've enjoyed using. After suffering through yet another Wordpress security breach (which I'll admit might be partly my fault through how I have my site set up and "maintained"), I've decided to take the next logical step and just move the whole thing to http://awestruct.org/[Awestruct].  Overall, it's been an enjoyable process, but it has certainly had it's bumps and bruises. Luckily, https://twitter.com/mojavelinux[Dan Allen], https://twitter.com/aslakknutsen[Aslak Knutsen], https://twitter.com/lightguardjp[Jason Porter], and https://twitter.com/bobmcwhirter[Bob McWhirter] have been kind and patient with me. :P

I'll have more to say in the coming days about with it took, what I've learned, etc., but I wanted to post a quick note letting both of my readers know about the change. You should find the site faster, as it's all static now, and much smaller (e.g., 16KB vs 47KB for the front page). Should you notice any issues, please let me know, as I still have a bit of cleaning up to do (e.g., images in older posts, implementing comments, etc). For now, though, enjoy the site. :)
