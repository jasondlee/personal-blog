= Building \"Fat Jars\" with Gradle
Jason Lee
2013-09-04


Sometimes, such as when building command line Java apps, it would be nice to bundle all of the app's dependencies in a single jar so that the user need not collect and manage these.  With Gradle, that can be easily accomplished with the following lines:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy,linenums]
----
jar {
    from {
        configurations.compile.collect {
            it.isDirectory() ? it : zipTree(it)
        }
        configurations.runtime.collect {
            it.isDirectory() ? it : zipTree(it)
        }
    }
}
----

When you run `gradle assemble`, you should find your now very hefty jar in `build/libs`.
