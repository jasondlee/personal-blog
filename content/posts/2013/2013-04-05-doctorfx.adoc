Earlier today, I link:/posts/2013/04/30/javafx-asciidoctor-a-qnd-hack[wrote] about a quick and dirty hack I put together to create a very simple editor for AsciiDoc files. While I have no immediate plans to make this a full-featured editor, there's a part of me that can't help but hack on it. This evening, I added support for loading and saving files. In fact, I'm using the editor to write this post. :)

For those interested in helping (or just need a good laugh :), you can find the code for this oh-so-cleverly-named project https://bitbucket.org/jdlee/doctorfx[here].
