This year was a very light year in blogging for me -- even by my recent standards --  for a lot of reasons that probably aren't of much interest to others. That said, I want to close the year out as I have for years with a Christmas post. I realize that many of you may not celebrate Christmas, and for others it's just another holiday plus lights and gifts and family. I would be remiss, though, if I didn't close the year sharing the real, historical meaning of Christmas: the birth of a baby sent to atone for the sins of the world. There's a lot of theology there that I won't unpack here, but, if you'd like to hear more -- or try to convince me that I'm wrong :) -- I'm here for you.

Here's a beautiful setting from Evan Wickham of some of that theology. I hope it blesses you as it did me.

Merry Christmas!

Breaking heaven’s silence we heard a human cry
Light into our darkness the Savior has arrived
Healing all the broken and teaching us to love
The Son of heaven’s glory now clothed in flesh and blood

Begotten not created from the Father before time
Virgin born Messiah both human and divine
Crucified and risen forever You will reign
We join with all the church from every age
Singing worthy is Lamb that was slain
