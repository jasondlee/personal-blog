= LiveJournal Export
Jason lee
2014-06-24


I have a personal LiveJournal blog that I'd like to migrate to link:posts/2012/07/16/a-new-way-to-blog/[Awestruct]. Unfortunately, LiveJournal's export tool is really limited, allowing the export of only one month at a time. There are tools to work around that, but the only ones I've seen require Windows, which rules me out. In typical geek fashion, then, I wrote my own tool, https://bitbucket.org/jdlee/ljexport[ljexport], a very quick-and-dirty JavaFX 8 application. All this does is export each month to its own file. Once you have the data, you're on your own. :)
