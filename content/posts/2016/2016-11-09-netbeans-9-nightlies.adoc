Perhaps I'm a bit of a glutton for punishment, but I have an odd addiction to nightly
builds. In working on this link:call-me-crazy-but-im-writing-a-book.html[book], I need
to use NetBeans 9, which, of course, is not out yet. They are, however, publishing
nightly builds. Being a command line guy at heart, I'd prefer not to have to go to the
http://bits.netbeans.org/netbeans/trunk/nightly/latest/[download page] every time, so I
did what any good geek would do: I wrote a script. It's not pretty, and it's not very
fault tolerant, but it seems to work well enough. If you're a fellow addict, here you
go:

[source, bash]

#!/bin/bash

VERS=`curl -s http://bits.netbeans.org/netbeans/trunk/nightly/latest/js/build_info.js | grep BOUNCER_PRODUCT_PREFIX | cut -f 2 -d \"`
FILE=$VERS-javase.zip

cd ~/Downloads
if [ ! -e $FILE ] ; then
    wget http://bits.netbeans.org/netbeans/trunk/nightly/latest/zip/$FILE
    if [ -e $FILE ] ; then
        rm -rf netbeans
        unzip $FILE
    fi
fi
