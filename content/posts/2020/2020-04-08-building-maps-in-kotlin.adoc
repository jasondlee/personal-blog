Over the years, I've found myself processing a set of data and storing it in a `Map`, say, something like `Map<Long, List<String>>` (think something like a list of `Room` objects, keyed by a building id). I have found myself writing it something like this (in non-idiomatic Kotlin):

[source,kotlin]
----
val foo = map.get(key)
if (foo == null) {
    foo = MutableList<String>()
    map.put(key, foo)
}
foo.add(bar)
----

Fortunately, the Kotlin standard library has a better way:

[source,kotlin]
----
map.getOrPut(key) { mutableListOf() }
    .add(bar)
----

If `key` is not found, the lambda is run, adding the result to `Map` and return to use the value, new or otherwise, to which we add `bar`. Much more concise. :) Generally speaking, any time you can let the language/compiler do the work for you, you're going to be better off.
