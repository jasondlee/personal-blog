= UPDATED: Web Beans Webinar
Jason Lee
2009-05-11

*On May 19th*, Pete Muir, JSF 2.0 Expert Group member and Web Beans implementation lead (if I recall correctly) will be leading, in conjunction with http://wikis.sun.com/display/TheAquarium/JCDI+-+JSR299[The Aquarium], a http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/WebinarOnJSR299ContextsAndDependencyInjection[webinar] covering the forthcoming Java Contexts and Dependency Injection JSR (JSR-299, formerly known by the JSR's former name, Web Beans).  Unfortunately, that's right in the middle of the Oklahoma City JUG's meeting, so I can't make it, especially since I'm this month's speaker.  For those of you that won't be attending the OKC JUG tomorrow, this should be a good session on a great spec.  I hope to catch the recording.  Not as good as attending live, but it's all I'll be able to manage.

Dan Allen was nice enough to point out that I misread the announcement, which means OKC people can hear me talk AND attend this webinar.  Win win! (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/[win]! ; )
