= GlassFish 3.1.2, REST Security, and the Jersey Client
Jason Lee
2012-03-12

I recently blogged about a change we made in GlassFish 3.1.2 with regard to REST security.  Specifically, we added some CSRF protection (you can read the details link:/posts/2012/03/01/glassfish-3-1-2-and-rest-security[here]).  For those of you using the Jersey Client, updating your code to support this change is very simple:

[source,java,linenums]
----
import com.sun.jersey.api.client.filter.CsrfProtectionFilter;
// ...
Client client = new Client();
client.addFilter(new CsrfProtectionFilter());
// ...
----

On the client side, that's all you have to change.  Jersey will take care of the details.
