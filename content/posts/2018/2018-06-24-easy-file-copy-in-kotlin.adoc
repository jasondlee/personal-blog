Copying files in Java is, I think, header than it seems it should be. Typically, I see that
done with, say, a `ByteArrayInputStream` and a `ByteArrayOutputStream` . Thanks to Kotlin's
https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html[extension function] capabilities, this
operation is a one-liner:

[source,kotlin]
----
File("/path/to/destination").writeBytes(File("/path/to/source").readBytes())
----

That could even be an extension function itself:

[source,kotlin]
----
fun File.copyFile(dest: File): Unit = dest.writeBytes(this.readBytes())
----
