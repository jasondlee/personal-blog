During the GlassFish v3 Prelude development cycle, the GlassFish team launched an initiative called FishCAT, which is our Community Acceptance Testing program.  The program was very successful for Prelude, resulting in many, many reported (and fixed! : ) issues for the Prelude release.  As we press hard toward the release of GlassFish v3 final later this fall, this program has been re-launched to help us engage our user community.  Through this program, testers will have a much greater impact on the final quality of the product when it finally ships.  If you'd like more information, you can see the announcement http://blogs.sun.com/judy/entry/announcing_v3_fishcat_a_community[here], and a description of the program http://wiki.glassfish.java.net/Wiki.jsp?page=FishCAT[here].
