This new release brings in a myriad of features, the most significant of which is probably clustering and high availability.  http://blogs.sun.com/theaquarium/entry/glassfish_3_1_is_here[The Aquarium] is the best place to find links to blogs, screencasts etc. from various GlassFish engineers (though Markus Eisele has a nice run down of the new features http://blog.eisele.net/2011/02/glassfish-31-arrived-yes-sir-we-do.html[here] as well).  The Aquarium's list is pretty extensive, so certainly check it out, but I'd like to highlight a few that I found interesting from teammates of mine:

People often ask what the difference is between the free GlassFish and the commercially-supported version.  The answer really is "not much" in terms of the core server itself (pretty much just branding changes).  The commercial version, though, has some nice value-add features, such as the http://blogs.sun.com/jenblog/entry/performance_tuner_in_oracle_glassfish[Performance Tuner], amongst others.

I'm really, really pleased with how GlassFish 3.1 has turned out.  We still (and will always) have more work to do, but this is a solid release that finally fills in some enterprise holes that v3 didn't have time to fill.  Download it, install it, kick the tires a bit, and tell us what you what http://java.net/jira/browse/GLASSFISH[you think].  In the meantime, we're going to go ahead and get started on 3.2.
