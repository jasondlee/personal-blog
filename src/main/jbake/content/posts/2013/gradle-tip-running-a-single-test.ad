= Gradle Tip: Running a Single Test

Using Maven, to run a single test (class), you would issue `mvn -Dtest=MyTest`. Gradle has similar functionality (`gradle -Dtest.single=MyTest`), though it seems to be much more powerful. You can get all the details http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/java_plugin.html#N12729[here].
