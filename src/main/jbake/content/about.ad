My name is Jason Lee. I'm a software developer living in the middle of Oklahoma. I've
been a professional developer since 1997, using a variety of languages, including Java, 
PHP, Python, Delphi, and even a bit of C#. I currently work for http://netsuite.com[NetSuite, Inc.], implementing
REST services and other server-side technologies for our industry-changing e-commerce 
solution. Previously, I have worked for Oracle Corporation (via Sun Microsystems),
implementing REST APIs for http://glassfish.org[GlassFish] and Weblogic Server. (Full resume
link:/resume.pdf[here]). I'm a member and former president of the http://okcjug.org[Oklahoma City JUG], and occasional speaker.

On the personal side, I'm married to a beautiful woman and have two kids, who, thankfully,
look like their mother. I'm active in my http://qsbc.org[church], lead a 
http://pack349.com[Cub Scout den], and am a black belt and instructor with a local
https://www.facebook.com/groups/PiedmontABKA[chapter] of http://abkakarate.com[ABKA Karate].
