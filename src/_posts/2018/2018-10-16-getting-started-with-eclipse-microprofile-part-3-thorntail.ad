In the last <</posts/2018/getting-started-with-eclipse-microprofile-part-2-payara-micro.ad#,installment>>, we talked about
Payara Micro. In this, we're going to look at https://thorntail.io/[Thorntail]. Thorntail, n√©e WildFly Swarm, is based
on WildFly from Red Hat and is said to be "just enough app-server". Much like Payara Micro, Thorntail exposes a
battle-tested application server platform, stripped down for microservices usage. Let's a take a look at what it takes
to deploy our application on Thorntail.

Before getting, it's worth pointing to the https://thorntail.io/documentation/[Thorntail documentation], which seems
to be very complete and thorough. If you'd like to peruse that now, feel free. We'll be here when you're done.

To get started, we need to create a new project, and add a few odds and ends to our build. Somewhat surprisingly, the
required changes seem to be much smaller and simpler than those required by Payara Micro:

I decided to include the entire POM, as it's really rather small. We import the BOM in `dependencyManagement`, add one
`dependency` to pull in Thorntail, one for our application, and one (*ONE*!) for the Arquillian tests. Likewise, we have
a single build plugin.

[NOTE]
====
I had to include an updated version for ShrinkWrap, as the version included transitively from `io.thorntail:arquillian`
was old and was causing test failures due to odd dependency look-ups against Central.
====

Like Payara Micro, we build this as a war file, so we have the same empty `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/beans.xml` file to
trigger CDI processing. That is literally all we have to do. I even copied and pasted the tests, which run unchanged (yes,
I could probably define those in another module and import them, but it's not that important to me right now. :)

When I run `mvn install`, I see the following in the `target` directory:

[source,bash]

#ll -h target/

 -rw-r--r-- 1 jdlee jdlee  74M Oct 15 13:32 thorntail-1.0-SNAPSHOT-thorntail.jar

And I can start my application using the `-thorntail.jar` uberjar:

[source,bash]
-----
# java -jar target/thorntail-1.0-SNAPSHOT-thorntail.jar
...
2018-10-15 13:37:15,328 INFO  [org.wildfly.extension.undertow] (ServerService Thread Pool -- 6) WFLYUT0021: Registered web context: '/' for server 'default-server'

2018-10-15 13:37:15,371 INFO  [org.wildfly.swarm] (main) THORN99999: Thorntail is Ready
-----

Manual testing works just the same as it did with Payara Micro:

[source,bash]
-----
# curl http://localhost:8080
Hello, world
# curl http://localhost:8080/?name=Thorntail
Hello, Thorntail
-----

With that, we've finished another simple MicroProfile deployment with zero changes to our application, and no container-specific
code, but we'll circle back to that idea when we wrap up the series.
