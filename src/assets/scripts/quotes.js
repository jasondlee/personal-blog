    {quote:'There\'s a big difference between freelance atheism by "skeptics" and atheism as the default faith system of a progressive culture largely ignorant of religion.

    {quote:'My dear Son...You mentioned that you read to your aunt a chapter in the Bible...every evening.

    {quote:'The other day when I turned on the tv, the channel was set, as it often is, to Noggin, the toddler network.

I flipped the channel before finding out whether abortion and taxes made the list.',source:'Ramesh Ponnuru'},
    {quote:'You cannot help men permanently by doing what they could and should do for themselves. You cannot help the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer. You cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than you earn. You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift. You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. You cannot further the brotherhood of man by encouraging class hatred. You cannot build character and courage by taking away man\'s initiative and independence.',source:'Abraham Lincoln (allegedly)'},

    {quote:'God assumed from the beginning that the wise of the world would view Christians as fools...and He has not been disappointed.

And have the courage to suffer the contempt of the sophisticated world.', source:'Antonin Scalia'},
