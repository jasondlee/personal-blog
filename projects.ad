While this is posted publicly, this status page is primarily intended for me to keep 
track of my many irons in the fire. Without further ado, then:

Cub Tracker
^^^^^^^^^^^
* Group replication
* Add awareness of when a scout has completed an item.
* Possible UI rework (Navigation Drawer)

Ceylon
^^^^^^
* Learn more about the language
* Implement something interesting
* Learn more about the async IO support

NetBeans Awestruct Plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Slim/HAML support. Keep an eye on jTilt/Tiltj
* Flesh out NetBake, the standalone wrapper for the plugin
* New file assumes a blog post
* New files aren't shown in the project view. Fix file list refreshing.

Blog Fodder
^^^^^^^^^^^
* Implement something. Anything. :P

FxTunes
^^^^^^^
* Fix MediaPlayer/song model binding
