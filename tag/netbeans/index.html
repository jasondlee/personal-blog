<p>Perhaps I&#8217;m a bit of a glutton for punishment, but I have an odd addiction to nightly
builds. In working on this <a href="call-me-crazy-but-im-writing-a-book.html">book</a>, I need
to use NetBeans 9, which, of course, is not out yet. They are, however, publishing
nightly builds. Being a command line guy at heart, I&#8217;d prefer not to have to go to the
<a href="http://bits.netbeans.org/netbeans/trunk/nightly/latest/">download page</a> every time, so I
did what any good geek would do: I wrote a script. It&#8217;s not pretty, and it&#8217;s not very
fault tolerant, but it seems to work well enough. If you&#8217;re a fellow addict, here you

        <a href="/2013/awestruct-netbeans-plugin">Awestruct NetBeans Plugin</a>
        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>Several weeks ago, I posted blurb about a JavaFX project I had cobbled together, <a href="/posts/2013/04/30/doctorfx">DoctorFX</a>.
It is an effort to build a semi-graphical editor for <a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/">Asciidoc</a>, but it is, currently,
very basic. I had some spare time last week, so I decided to add some features to it. As I thought about what needed to
be added and what that would require, I thought that, perhaps, an architectural change was warranted. With some time and
an itch, I pulled out the sledge hammer and out came a NetBeans plugin. This plugin though, does more than Asciidoc: it
offers full(-ish) support for the <a href="http://awestruct.org/">Awestruct</a> framework.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a lot of features I&#8217;d like to add still, but, currently it supports only basic project loading and editing.
It technically has code to preview Asciidoc files, though I&#8217;m having issues getting the rendered page from displaying.
(In case you want to take a crack at it, that code is <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jdlee/awestruct-netbeans-plugin/src/0cc633ca5447377c8ce9e316208699f25e5a248b/src/com/steeplesoft/awestruct/netbeans/filetype/asciidoc/AsciidocVisualElementPanel.java?at=master">here</a>.)
I&#8217;d also like to add preview support for Slim and Haml, but that may have to wait a bit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;d like to lend a hand to the effort, you can find the current source on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jdlee/awestruct-netbeans-plugin">Bitbucket</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is, of course, a bit heavier than DoctorFX, but most of my work with Asciidoc is, currently, in the context
of Awestruct, so this fits my needs better, and it was fun dipping my toes into the NetBeans Platform API. :)</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>In a recent post showing how to use JavaFX 2 and NetBeans on the Mac, I noted that I have been unable to run NetBeans using Java 7 on my Mac for reasons I had not been able to figure out.  Now, thanks to a pointer from <a href="http://skovatch.wordpress.com/">Scott Kovatch</a>, the technical lead at Oracle for the Mac OS X port of Java, I think I can show you how to do that.</p>

<p>image::/images/2012/04/javafx_logo_color_1-300x150.jpg</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you may have guessed from my recent <a href="/2012/04/book-review-pro-javafx-2-a-definitive-guide-to-rich-clients-with-java-technology/">book review</a>, I&#8217;ve been tinkering with JavaFX some, as time as permitted.  I&#8217;ve been following the technology fairly closely since Sun announced the project way back in 2008.  When it was announced that JavaFX 2.0 was <em>finally</em> available, albeit in preview form, for the Mac, I was ecstatic.  I ran into issues, though, trying to get it to run in my <a href="http://netbeans.org">IDE</a>, though.  After some guess work and googling, I finally figured it out.  In retrospect, it may be obvious, but if you&#8217;re like me and are missing the obvious, I&#8217;m going to detail the steps I took to get it running on my Mac.  Perhaps it can help someone out.more</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first step, of course, is to download the binaries.  You can do that <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javafx/downloads/index.html">here</a>, sort of.  Since this is still a preview release at the time of this writing, you have click the teeny tiny <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javafx/downloads/devpreview-1429449.html">link</a> under the header.  Once you&#8217;ve downloaded the distribution, you need to extract it somewhere:</p>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can, of course, put it anywhere you want, but you&#8217;ll need to adjust the following instructions.  The next step is set up NetBeans.  NetBeans has JavaFX support out of the box, assuming your JDK has JavaFX support.  Since the Mac JDK does not yet, we need fix that.  Otherwise, you&#8217;ll see this error:</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To fix this, we need to create a Java Platform with JavaFX support (I don&#8217;t know why we can&#8217;t modify the default platform, but we can&#8217;t, so we get to create a new one, which we can set to be the default if we want).  To do that, go to Tools &gt; Java Platforms, where you should see something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<a class="image" href="/images/2012/04/javaplatforms-300x185.png"><img src="/images/2012/04/javaplatforms.png" alt="javaplatforms" width="title: "'Java Platforms'""></a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To create a new Java Platform, click the (wait for it&#8230;&#8203;!) "Add Platform&#8230;&#8203;" button in the lower left corner.  OS X likes to put things in decidedly (to me) un-Unixy locations, and the JDK is no different. You can find the current JDK under <code>/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

<a class="image" href="/images/2012/04/selectjdk.png"><img src="/images/2012/04/selectjdk-300x185.png" alt="selectjdk 300x185" width="title: "'Select JDK Home'""></a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We now need to give it a name, so we&#8217;ll call this "JDK 1.6 with JavaFX" and click OK.  But wait, there&#8217;s no JavaFX support! To enable JavaFX support, we have to&#8230;&#8203;um..enable it.  Doing so looks like this:</p>

<div class="imageblock">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can now create a new JavaFX project:</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your new project is ready to run.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The even more adventurous may be wondering how one would do this with Java 7, to which I say, "Good question!" : )  I have mixed luck getting NetBeans and Java 7 to play nice on my Mac.  It&#8217;s almost certainly pilot error, as I&#8217;ve done it before, as has <a href="http://www.adam-bien.com/roller/abien/entry/how_to_run_netbeans_7">Adam Bien</a>, but I haven&#8217;t had a chance to debug things (e.g., the navigation tree under projects has all the tree icons, but no text.  IIRC, the context menus are also text-less. Strange).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At any rate, as I noted earlier, in retrospect, this seems pretty easy (if a bit unintuitive) and might be documented somewhere, but I couldn&#8217;t find it.  Either way, it&#8217;s certainly documented now.  I hope it helps. : )</p>

<h1>2008</h1>



<h2>November</h2>
<ul>
    
    <li>
        <a href="/2008/netbeans-65-python-support-and-mac-os-x">NetBeans 6.5, Python Support, and Mac OS X</a>
        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>The NetBeans team recently released version 6.5 of the NetBeans IDE, which I really, really like.  They also released an Early Access peek at the Python support coming for NetBeans.  Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not straightforward to get Python and Java EE support in the same installation.  The Python EA release is a complete NetBeans installation, i.e., you can&#8217;t just add the modules to an existing NetBeans installation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fortunately, there is a pretty easy solution to this: if you already have an existing 6.5 installation, you can simply run the Python EA installer, which will detect the existing 6.5 install and update it to add Python support.  Unfortunately, the installer has a bug on OS X, which breaks this functionality.  The end result is that your existing installation is replaced, which is likely not what you want.  The good news is that there is a workaround, albeit ugly and manual, to get us Mac users running while they fix the installer issue.  Here are the steps I followed to add Python support to NetBeans 6.5 on the Mac (big thanks to the NetBeans Users list for the tips that led to this solution):</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make sure NetBeans is not running</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download python cluster separately from <a href="http://download.netbeans.org/netbeans/6.5/python/ea/zip.html" class="bare">http://download.netbeans.org/netbeans/6.5/python/ea/zip.html</a> (search for netbeans-6.5-200811131701-python.zip&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;or whatever the latest is&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;in the second list "Module Clusters")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put contents of the python1 directory in the zip in $HOME/.netbeans/6.5</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delete directory $HOME/.netbeans/6.5/var/cache</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add "python1" to /Applications/NetBeans/NetBeans 6.5.app/Contents/Resources/NetBeans/etc/netbeans.clusters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start NetBeans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Profit? :)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should now be able to create a new Python project.  The installer bug should be fixed in the next release (my guess is that it&#8217;s already fixed in the NB hg repo), but these "easy" steps should get you going in the interim.</p>

married to a beautiful woman, and have two boys, who, thankfully, look like their mother.</p>
