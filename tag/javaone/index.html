<p>My day started today with the Intel general session.  I went in with low expectations for some reason, but came away pretty pleased.  The speaker, Douglas Fisher, Vice President, Software and Solutions Group and General Manager, Systems Software Division of Intel Corporation, talked about how software drives innovation in hardware, which makes possible more interesting things in hardware, which in turn drives more innovation in hardware, and the cycle repeats.  Years ago, an Intel exec whose name escapes me  described this as the software spiral.  He then brought a Sun exec (Jeet Kaul, if I recall correctly) onto the stage to discuss performance gains in the JVM, presumably in the virtualization space.  He shared how from January 2007 to JavaOne 2007, they made a 20% gain in performance, so they set their goal for JavaOne 2008 at 60%.  They announced today a 68% gain, with the demo peaking at 74%, on the exact same hardware and software that was used last year.  The only difference was the JVM.  Very cool.</p>

<p>Day 2 of JavaOne is effectively over.  As I sit here typing, I have one more event, the hands-on-lab Plug Into GlassFish™ V3 With JavaServer™ Faces and jMaki in about an hour, which should be really good.  It&#8217;s basically a lab showing how to do what Jerome demoed yesterday afternoon in the general session when he added a feature to the GlassFish admin console.</p>

<p>Good morning.  It&#8217;s time for my JavaOne 2008 Day 1 report (though it&#8217;s actually the morning of the 2nd day :).  Thanks to the graciousness of Sun Microsystems, I&#8217;m here on the Java Blogger program, giving me <em>really</em> amazing access and privileges.  All I have to do is blog about my experience, which I would have done anyway, so over the next few days, I&#8217;ll be filing "reports" on what I&#8217;ve seen and heard.  So, with that introduction out of the way, let&#8217;s recap day 1.</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>Next week, I&#8217;ll be off to JavaOne.  With everything that&#8217;s going on, I thought it would be nice to have my JavaOne schedule on my Google Calendar, which I could then sync with my phone.  Sadly, it wasn&#8217;t as easy as I thought it would be (though I certainly could be the failure in the process :).  After I imported my schedule into Outlook (used only&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and grudgingly&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;as iTunes is broken in that it only supports Outlook) and then synced that with my Google Calendar, all of the event start times were adjusted for the time zone differences.  Importing by CSV resulted in cryptic messages about my calendar not being available, so I did what any good geek would do:  I wrote my own solution, creatively named J1Sync.</p>
