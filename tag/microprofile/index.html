<p>As part of some of my recent work, I&#8217;ve gotten some exposure to some Microprofile specs I&#8217;ve not had the opportunity or need to use. One of those is <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance">Fault Tolerance</a>. I was curious to see it action, so I&#8217;ve cobbled together this simple example that demonstrates some of that spec&#8217;s features, namely retries and fallback.</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>Many times, one of the hardest parts of getting started with a particular piece of technology is figuring out how to get
started. :) In this series, I&#8217;ve used an <em>extremely</em> simple project to show how to do just that with a number of MicroProfile
implementations. Obviously, a real application will have many more concerns than we dealt with in this application, but
what this effort gave us is working, runnable, and  testable build for six different MicroProfile implementations. What
I&#8217;d like to do in this final installment in the series, is give some closing thoughts.</p>

<p>Up next in our series comes an offering from, to me, a somewhat surprising source, Oracle, and that offering is
<a href="https://helidon.io/">Helidon</a>. I first heard about in
<a href="https://medium.com/oracledevs/helidon-takes-flight-fb7e9e390e9c">September 2018</a>, and while it&#8217;s still pre-1.0, it
looks extremely promising.</p>

<p>This time around, we&#8217;re going to start looking at a slightly different take on MicroProfile implemenations. Whereas
Payara Micro, Thorntail, OpenLibery, and TomEE are all based on application servers (albeit stripped down versions), our
implementation in this post, <a href="https://hammock-project.github.io/">Hammock</a>, is based on a CDI container. Rather than start
what amounts to an app server under which a web is deployed, we&#8217;ll be spinning up a plain ol' CDI container, which will
look for CDI beans to load/start/etc. That may sound weird, and I may not be describing it clearly, so let&#8217;s just jump in
to the code and take a look.</p>

<p>In this installment of our series, we&#8217;re going to take a look at the last of what I think of as the more traditional,
app-server-based/-spawned implementations, <a href="http://tomee.apache.org">TomEE</a>. TomEE is a fully Java EE-enabled distribution
of the venerable workhorse Tomcat, and comes with support for creating MicroProfile applications, so let&#8217;s see what that
looks like.</p>

under which, as I understand the state of things, IBM&#8217;s WebSphere Liberty is developed. In this installment, we&#8217;ll

Payara Micro. In this, we&#8217;re going to look at <a href="https://thorntail.io/">Thorntail</a>. Thorntail, n√©e WildFly Swarm, is based
on WildFly from Red Hat and is said to be "just enough app-server". Much like Payara Micro, Thorntail exposes a
battle-tested application server platform, stripped down for microservices usage. Let&#8217;s a take a look at what it takes
to deploy our application on Thorntail.</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>To start our investigation, we need an application to work with. Part of the problem with getting started
applications is making sure that your example is complicated enough to be interesting, but not so complicated that
the greater message is lost in the details of the app. MicroProfile 2.0 is made up of a number of components:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>MicroProfile Config 1.3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MicroProfile Fault Tolerance 1.1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MicroProfile Health Check 1.0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MicroProfile JWT Authentication 1.1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MicroProfile Metrics 1.1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MicroProfile OpenAPI 1.0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MicroProfile OpenTracing 1.1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MicroProfile Rest Client 1.1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CDI 2.0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Common Annotations 1.3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JAX-RS 2.1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JSON-B 1.0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JSON-P 1.1</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To include <strong>all</strong> of those in this would probably be a bit too much technical weight for a getting started effort, so,
for this example, I&#8217;ve leaned (probably too far) toward simple. Our application will have a single JAX-RS resource, into
which is injected a single CDI bean. The point is to have a working REST endpoint, with an inject "service layer", to show
a MicroProfile in action, allowing us to verify that our basic environment is configured and working correctly. From there
you are free to load on all the complexity you find you need. That&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;ll be doing in a separate project. :)</p>

The <a href="http://microprofile.io">Eclipse MicroProfile</a> is a community-driven profile initially developed by Red Hat, IBM,
TomiTribe, Payara and the London Java Community (LJC).
<a href="https://microprofile.io/2016/06/29/announcing-java-ee-microprofile/">Launched in 2016</a>, it was intended to sit alongside
Java EE&#8217;s Web and Full profiles, offering Java EE developers a smaller, lighter set of standards with which they could
build microservices. Today, MicroProfile lives as an Eclipse project, and is being supported and actively developed by
its creators as well as many more, including both corporations and individuals, giving us an embarassment of riches, if
you will, when it comes to implementations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By my count, there are at least 6 implementations from which to choose,
leading to the question: Which one do I choose? While there are many aspects that factor in to such a decision, it is not
my intent here to answer those questions. Rather, what I&#8217;d like to do is provided some small "getting started" projects
to help you kick off your own investigation. With that in mind, here are the implementations (in no particular order)
that we&#8217;re going to look at:</p>

<div class="ulist">

<p>In <a href="/posts/2018/getting-started-with-eclipse-microprofile-part-1-the-app.html">Part 1</a>, we&#8217;ll cover the (admittedly absurdly basic) application, and in subsequent parts, we&#8217;ll see what it takes
to deploy that application using each of these MicroProfile implementations.</p>
