<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I joined Sun Microsystems "way back" in 2008, I was asked if I wanted a Mac for my work system.  Having heard many extol the numerous virtues of the OS, I jumped at the chance.  Since then, I&#8217;ve even migrated my wife and family to the OS.  Trouble arose last fall, though, with the delivery of a new MacBook Pro (whose purchase was somewhat a miracle, brought about by the tireless efforts from my upper management).  Simply put, I got a lemon.  After five trips to the Apple Store, which resulted in overnight diagnostic runs; shipment to an offsite, more advanced repair facility; the replacement of the hard drive; and the replacement of the motherboard, I finally broke down and asked for a new machine, knowing it wouldn&#8217;t be a Mac.  Just over a week ago, a new Lenovo Thinkpad arrived, and, after putting Linux on it, I have to say I&#8217;m generally very happy with the system.more</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, Apple puts together a very nice system in the MacBook Pro.  The machine is a physical beauty, and the OS is veyr polished and user-friendly.  As a developer, though, there were somethings that bothered me.  The lack of any real visibility (that I could find) into the packaging system, the use of plists over conventional Unix configuration files, the odd command-line parameter parsing in the shell, the nearly universal requirement to use the mouse, the odd keyboard layout, etc. had been grating on me.  Now I&#8217;l grant that many of these are silly or easily resolved, but they were different enough from years of habit-building that I never could get completely used to them, nor could I find workarounds that I really cared for.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From a user experience, my complaints realy boil down to personal preferences.  Many will likely read this list and think I&#8217;m quite a crank for my age, and that&#8217;s fine.  We all have different preferences (I recently read a blurb about a Haskell developer&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;I forget his name&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;who prefers <em>Windows!</em>.  Now <em>that&#8217;s</em> crazy, right? ;).  At the end of the day, I had some minor quibbles with the OS, but I sucked it up and pressed on, and was generally pretty productive.  Much more than I was on the Windows laptop at my last gig.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enter Linux.  Or, I should say, re-enter Linux.  I&#8217;ve been using Linux for many, many years now, so many of the annoyances I found when using OS X were the result of forming habits in that other Unix-like OS.  On this new machine, I installed Linux Mint, which seems to the flavor of the day in some circles, and was mostly pleased.  I had some odd issues with menus in NetBeans that seem to be GNOME-related, so I tried LXDE, which I found to be a bit&#8230;&#8203;ugly, and finally KDE, with which I had some stability issues.  Over the course of part of an afternoon, then, I installed Ubuntu 12.04, since I had read that they fixed all the woes that at first plagued Unity.  Surprisingly, I&#8217;m pretty happy with Unity.  It has its issues, but the system is fast and stable, and lets me work the way I prefer, which is all I really wanted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given my experience with this latest system, I doubt I&#8217;ll return to OS X in the near future.  For me, Linux on the desktop is just about right.  The price certainly is.</p>
