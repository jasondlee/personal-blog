        <div><div class="paragraph">

</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last night, I had the opportunity to present at my local jug, the <a href="https://okcjug.org">Oklahoma City Java User Group</a>. My topic was building applications Kotlin/Compose Multiplatform. For the most part, it was awesome. More on that in a moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://jasondl.ee/presentations/compose-multiplatform/">presentation</a> was an introduction to the technologies that I&#8217;ve found helpful in building cross-platform applications. I tried to be clear that what I was presenting is my <em>current</em> architecture and that things might change, and that I was <em>learning</em> some of these things as I go. I find it helpful to present on things that I&#8217;m learning, as it helps solidify things in my own mind, and it might be useful for others to travel along with me, so to speak. I won&#8217;t recap here everything in the presentation, so if you&#8217;d like details, you can flip through the <a href="https://jasondl.ee/presentations/compose-multiplatform/">slides</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The demo app is one I&#8217;ve called (because I&#8217;m a sucker for puns), "Giftbook"&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;like "Facebook", but for gifts. The inspiration for the app (which is in part intended to serve as an architectural reference app for my younger son as he builds a mobile app for a high school class, as well as for a project my wife and I are working on together) came from my wife. She typically handles the bulk of our gift shopping, and she uses an app to help keep track of that. The app is great and helpful, but it has shortcomings, and in the course of discussing those, we did what any good geek would do: we decided to build our own. It&#8217;s still a work in progress, but you can follow along (and contribute if you want) over at <a href="https://github.com/jasondlee/giftbook">Github</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I said the meeting was awesome "for the most part" earlier. I had hoped to have a video of the presentation to post the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OklahomaCityJUG">OKC JUG YouTube channel</a>, but&#8230;&#8203; there were problems. Since I was presenting, I couldn&#8217;t run the recording device, so I conscripted my beautiful and brilliant wife to do handle that, and she did great, but the forces against us were greater. :) A big part of the problem is OBS. I spent part of the morning yesterday making sure everything was set up and working, but when we got to the venue, OBS had forgotten input devices, microphone levels were messed up, etc., so we had to hastily try to reconfigure things moments before the session started. Neither of us know OBS well, and we mostly got it working, but the audio in the video we ended up actually getting was great, then silent, then really low. Not sure what was going on there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The coup de grâce for the recording, though, happened when the laptop died. :P What we didn&#8217;t notice was that the power strip was not turned on, so the laptop was running on battery until it wasn&#8217;t. We did manage to record about two-thirds of the presentation before things completely fell over, but the audio is next to useless, making the video a bit of a waste.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I learned (or had reinforced) a few things, though: I need to learn OBS better (or find a simpler replacement), and I need to conscript more dedicated help. I had a million plates spinning last night, and I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to pull of the meeting if it hadn&#8217;t been for my amazing wife (I&#8217;ve said this directly to her, but I&#8217;ll say it again here: A HUGE thanks for the help. You&#8217;re awesome. :)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given all of that, there&#8217;s a chance I&#8217;ll make a recording of the presentation from my office so I can have something to upload. I need to tweak the presentation a bit (including replacing that super dumb and boring title, something my wife and older son have been helping me brainstorm), so if I can find some time, I&#8217;ll make those changes and try to put a recording.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite the technical woes, I had a great time seeing old friends at the JUG, and even got to meet a few new people, which is always great. Having part of my family there was big bonus, as well.</p>

<p>I have a grand total of one Android application in the Play Store, Cub Tracker. It serves
two functions for me: it helps me manage my sons' Cub Scout den, and it gives me a means
for experimentation in the mobile realm. For the most part, it has done well for me on both
counts for the past few years. I am currently faced with an issue of new functionality (which
is mostly irrelevant for this discussion) that has brought up a question in the realm of
experimentation. This post is a discussion of my options which will allow me to think
out loud, if you will, as well as getting (I hope) some feedback on my options.</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image right"><img src="http://www.manning.com/sessa/sessa_cover150.jpg" alt="Cover"></span><a href="http://www.manning.com/sessa/"><em>50 Android Hacks</em></a> by Carl Sessa is, as you may have deduced from the title, a collection of 50 tips and tricks to help Android developers of all skill levels handle a variety of problems. For the most part, I found the book very helpful. Before I get to that, I have a minor quibble: I&#8217;m not sure "hacks" was the best choice of words. I understand the marketing aspect of it, but when I hear "hack", I think of a piece of code I&#8217;m embarrassed to share with someone else, of something I&#8217;d prefer to hide. These "hacks" seem anything but. Clean, clear, efficient, something to be proud of. It&#8217;s a minor quibble, of course, but there it is. :)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The book itself is pretty easily laid out. If you&#8217;ve read a "cookbook", then you should be comfortable and familiar with the basic layout. Each chapter is a different tip, which range from the "easy" (e.g., centering text in a view) to the more advanced (e.g., using the <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/sync-adapters/creating-sync-adapter.html">SyncAdapter</a>). The topics covered include layouts, animations, build tools and more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I read this, appropriately enough, using the Kindle App on my Android tablet, and the experience was very good. I&#8217;ve read several programming books on my tablet, and they usually have issues with unreadable source code, large blanks due to content flow issues, etc. Some of this is affected, of course, by the font size and is fixable, but I saw none of those issues here. All of the source, both XML and Java, were neatly formatted and readable, with no odd, jarring line wrap issues. The graphics were crisp and readable, and the pages were neat and clean.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a great book, especially for beginning to intermediate Android developers, but I&#8217;d wager that there&#8217;s something here for just about everyone.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been getting a number of bug reports from my app <a href="http://cubtracker.com">Cub Tracker</a> that had me stumped. I was getting NullPointerExceptions where I shouldn&#8217;t be. After some digging, I think I finally found the culprit: device rotation. While rotating the device does, indeed, trigger the error, it goes deeper than that. My problem is that the app doesn&#8217;t correctly save the state of the view, which becomes problematic when, for example, the device is rotated. In trying to fix that, I discovered I don&#8217;t understand the Android lifecycle as well as I should, so I set out to fix that.</p>

<p>While I love my Android devices, one thing that has always bugged me is syncing music with them. Sure, there are some apps that claim to be able to do it, but I&#8217;ve never found one that will do what it says <em>and</em> be a decent music player at the same time (perhaps someone out there can point me to a good one). For the most part, then, I&#8217;ve settled on Banshee (which, as far as I can tell, doesn&#8217;t sync, but is a decent player<sup>1</sup>). Here, then, is my very manual process for syncing music.</p>

<p>As every Android developer knows, application crashes are reported back to Google and can be view in the Play Developer&#8217;s Console. This is helpful, but, in my experience, sometimes you don&#8217;t get enough context. You also don&#8217;t get notifications when crashes are reported.  Fortunately, there is a tool, called <a href="http://acra.ch">ACRA</a>, that improves the situation quite a bit. In this post, I&#8217;ll give you a brief introduction to the tool, and how I use it in <a href="http://cubtracker.com">Cub Tracker</a>.</p>

<p>As some of you may or may not know, I have small Android project, <a href="http://cubtracker.com">Cub Tracker</a>, that I&#8217;ve been working on for quite some time now in my spare time.  I&#8217;ve been trying to be better about quicker releases, but all the testing for the app is currently manual (and, therefore, hit-and-miss), so updates tend to be a bit slower and very cautious.  (For the record, it used to have pretty decent tests, but I rewrote the app for version 2 and just never got around to porting/rewriting the tests.)  My next change, though, will be pretty invasive, so I&#8217;ve decided it&#8217;s time to fix that.  In doing so, though, I hit a snag pretty quickly.  Cub Tracker now uses a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/view/ViewPager.html">ViewPager</a> as the main form of navigation, and I quickly realized I didn&#8217;t know how to swipe from one page to another. It turns out there are several different ways to do it. Here are some&#8230;&#8203;</p>

<p>For a few months now, I&#8217;ve been working on a small application called <a href="http://cubtracker.com">Cub Tracker</a> which is designed to help Cub Scout den and pack leaders track the progress of the scouts assigned them.  I&#8217;m a big fan of testing, so I&#8217;ve done my best to follow TDD as I&#8217;ve worked on the app.  Early on, it became clear that I needed a better way to test, as the official Android app is slow and unreliable at times.  Via Twitter, I was turned on to <a href="http://www.android-x86.org/">Android-x86</a> and after a couple nights of hacking, I think I have a usable installation of Android-x86 under <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> that has sped up my testing considerably.

<p>Today, I presented basic Android development at the Oklahoma City JUG.  In the presentation, we walked through a very simple (and very ugly) note-taking application.  The app allows the user to list, view, add, edit, and delete notes.  There are no bells and whistles in the app, as I was trying to find something that is non-trivial enough to be interesting, yet no so complex that the audience gets lost in all the details.  Overall, I think I succeeded there, though I guess the evaluation slips should tell me how far off I really was. :)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As I said at the start of the talk, it&#8217;s not a pretty app, and I likely violate many of the best practices the Google and other experts suggest, but it&#8217;s a functional app and, for that reason alone, I think, a decent start.  I&#8217;ve pushed the sources to <a href="https://github.com/jasondlee/AndroidNotesDemo">GitHub</a> so anyone can take a look at it, fork it, etc.  As time permits, I hope to clean the code up some, and add, via comments, some of the discussion we had in the talk itself.  That will likely make the code a bit more valuable and interesting.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, I <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.steeplesoft.cubtracker&amp;feature=search_result">published</a> my first Android application, <a href="http://cubtracker.com">Cub Tracker</a>.  Cub Tracker is really a pretty simple application, but one born out of a personal need. My oldest son is a Cub Scout Wolf, and I am his den leader.  There have been countless times where we had been out somewhere, and my wife and I would ask each other, "I wonder if there&#8217;s a Cub Scout achievement or elective for this?"  At the time, there was no easy to find out.  There are web sites that list these, of course, but it wasn&#8217;t convenient to load the page and search it while we&#8217;re in the middle of something.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given what I do for a living, I immediately thought, "There should be an app for that!" and Cub Tracker was born.  I won&#8217;t go into all the details here (there&#8217;s a <a href="http://cubtracker.com">site</a> for that, though it&#8217;s pretty bare at the moment), but Cub Tracker allows you to track the achievements and electives of one or more Cub Scouts on your mobile device.  It will also generate a report that can be emailed to, say, your Scout&#8217;s den leader.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s not flashy and probably isn&#8217;t very exciting for many people, but I&#8217;m pretty proud of it and expect I&#8217;ll get a lot of use out of it.  If you have a Scout, please check it out and let me know what you think.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been an iPhone user for about 1.5 years now.  I&#8217;m mostly happy with it, but I&#8217;d kinda like to write applications for it.  The problem, though, is that the iPhone uses Objective-C (and I don&#8217;t consider writing web apps the same thing as writing an iPhone app ; ).  Enter Google&#8217;s Android.  I can use my existing Java knowledge to write applications for an Android device, giving me a much smaller learning curve.  The question, then, is which device should I get?  There are several available, unlike the iPhone, so the choice can be difficult.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recently, I ran across <a href="http://www.linuxlinks.com/article/20100206062016681/Android.html">6 of the Best Android Mobile Devices</a>, which has a pretty nice run down of six different devices, not all of which are phones.  The problem with this particular comparison, was that each phone was on a different page, making comparison more difficult as I had to switch tabs a lot.  My solution, then, is the table below.  Inspired by the link above, though taking most of the data from the devices' product pages, I&#8217;ve compiled the following table.  Obviously, this isn&#8217;t every Android phone on the market.  I took the three listed in the article above, and added one other phone that I&#8217;ve been considering.  Hopefully this table will be helpful in those looking at these devices.</p>
