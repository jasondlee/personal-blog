<p>There&#8217;s a chance that at least some of you saw the blog title and thought: "Ah ha!
A Kotlin wrapper/helper for JSF!" and rushed over to check it out. If so, mission
accomplished. :) This really isn&#8217;t anything that ambitious. Sorry. :)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At JavaOne this week, I spent a good deal of time talk to
<a href="https://twitter.com/hhariri">Hadi Hariri</a>, Developer Advocacy Team Lead at JetBrains,
about their <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a> language. With my long background in
Java webapps, I often reach for my webapp hammer when trying to learn a new language, so
I asked Hadi what Kotlin library he would suggest. His answer, in a nutshell, was that
the Java interop in Kotlin is so good, just use whatever you want, so I thought I&#8217;d
put that to the test with a <em>really</em> simple JSF app. Here it is.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.webjars.org/">WebJars</a>, for those that haven&#8217;t heard, is a project that takes popular client-side web libraries and packages them in JARs to make their use in Java-/JVM-based web apps simpler. The web site notes that you can easily see which libraries a project is using simply by looking at its dependencies, and that transitive dependencies automatically appear. It&#8217;s a pretty compelling project, but, for some reason, it doesn&#8217;t <a href="http://www.webjars.org/documentation">show how to integrate it</a> with JSF. I&#8217;d like to think it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s so trivial, but I&#8217;ll show it here anyway. :)</p>

<p>At a recent meeting of the Oklahoma City JUG, I was asked by a member how her group could "script" JSF report generation.  After a couple of questions, I figured what she really wanted:  she wanted a way to allow users to request reports in an ad hoc manner, as opposed to the reports being run on a schedule.  In a general sense, this is a pretty easy question to answer, but I&#8217;ve run into situations where the reports take a long time to run&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and I&#8217;m sure she will, as well&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;making a web interface for generating the report less useful (due to timeouts, etc).

<p>One of the nicest enhancements to the JSF specification that 2.0 brought was the inclusion of native Ajax support.  It is now extremely simple to Ajaxify a JSF application.  One thing that it lacks, though, is the ability to call arbitrary methods on JSF (or CDI?) Managed Beans.  There is a project that offers that kind of functionality, and it&#8217;s been around for years:  <a href="http://directwebremoting.org/dwr">Direct Web Remoting</a>.  I&#8217;ve used this library at times and have found it to be really useful in certain situations.  That got me to wondering, Should this kind of functionality be a first class citizen of JSF?  To help us decide, let&#8217;s take a quick look at how DWR works.</p>

        <a href="/2010/book-review-jsf-2-0-cookbook">Book Review: JSF 2.0 Cookbook</a>
        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>image::https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/productview/9522.jpg</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Packt Publishing recently released a book titled <em><a href="https://www.packtpub.com/jsf-2-0-cookbook/book">JSF 2.0 Cookbook</a></em>, by Anghel Leonard.  When I first heard about this book, I was really anxious to get my hands on it.  I really like the cookbook concept, so I was excited to see a work in that vein published for JSF.  Packt recently sent me a copy to review, so, having read most of the book, here are my thoughts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First off, I&#8217;ll be upfront:  I have not read the whole book, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a problem.  Cookbooks aren&#8217;t meant to be read cover to cover, necessarily.  While you can certainly do that, these types of books are intended to be a reference.  When you have an issue, you look in the table of contents to find the "recipe" that covers your issue, and jump to that page.  That&#8217;s what I did with this book, mostly.  I looked up the recipes for issues I most often have trouble with.  I did, though, read almost all of the custom component chapter, as that&#8217;s area that holds a lot of interest for me.  I&#8217;ll give that one special attention in a moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each recipe, follows the same basic pattern.  It starts with a basic summary of the problem, then goes in to "Getting ready," "How to do it&#8230;&#8203;," "How it works&#8230;&#8203;" and "See also."  There are minor deviations along the way, but that&#8217;s the basic gist.  In the <em>Getting Ready</em> section, the author details how the recipe was created (NetBeans 6.8, Mojarra 2.x, and GlassFish v3, showing the author has <strong>great</strong> tastes : ), so new users can get a sense of what might help work through the recipe. The <em>How to do it</em> section is pretty detailed, with LOTS of source code.  Much of the markup is still using JSP, which is a shame since JSP is all but formally deprecated with JSF 2.0 (Facelets being the de facto standard), but you shouldn&#8217;t have any major issues applying what you see to a Facelets page.  The <em>How it works</em> section that follows does a great job of explaining&#8230;&#8203;err&#8230;&#8203; how it works, which I think is really important.  How to do something is rarely enough.  If you understand <em>why</em> to do something and <em>how</em> that something works, you&#8217;ll be better equipped in the future for similar, but slightly different issues.  This section does a good job of that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The only area of the book I want to comment on specifically is Chapter 5, <em>Custom Components</em>.  Of all the areas in JSF, component authoring has always been a favorite of mine.  I am far from being a leading expert, but I&#8217;m pretty comfortable with it and really enjoy it.  Chapter 5, then, was one of the first things I turned to.  The author does a great job of giving a variety of examples using validators, ajax, etc.  A big glaring flaw for me, though, was the discussion of the JSF lifecycle, a very important topic for component authors.  In the graphic on page 130, encoding is shown as happening in the <strong>Apply Request Values Phase</strong>, and decoding is shown as happening in the <strong>Render Response Phase</strong>.  Unless I&#8217;m sorely mistaken, that&#8217;s exactly backwards.  Despite that error, the chapter itself is extremely helpful.  I would advise, though, that if you are looking to learn component development, to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaServer-Faces-2-0-Complete-Reference/dp/0071625097/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1282337841&amp;sr=8-2">JavaServer Faces 2.0: The Complete Reference</a> by Ed Burns, and Chris Schalk, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Core-JavaServer-Faces-David-Geary/dp/0137012896/ref=pd_sim_b_3">Core JSF</a> by David Geary and Cay Horstmann.  That&#8217;s not to belittle this book in anyway.  The Geary/Hortsmann and Burns/Schalk books are meant for different purposes. <em>JSF 2.0 Cookbook</em> has a slightly different purpose, which is complementary to the first two, and which it does well, I think.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Overall, I think this is a really good book.  Though not perfect, it provides a lot of value to the JSF developer.  From beginner to expert, I think there is enough in this book to help just about everyone out of a jam from time to time.</p>

<p>The migration of Mojarra Scales to JSF 2, adding new components has become much easier due to JSF 2&#8217;s new composite component feature.

        <a href="/2009/the-mojarra-scales-demo-has-moved">The Mojarra Scales Demo Has Moved</a>
        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>With the recent migration of <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/scales/pages/Home">Mojarra Scales</a> to <a href="https://javaserverfaces.dev.java.net">JSF 2</a>, the old location of the Mojarra Scales demo was no longer adequate (upgrading that server posed some issues).  For that reason, I have moved the demo to a <a href="http://demo.steeplesoft.com/mojarra-scales-demo/index.jsf">new home</a>.  This server should be more up-to-date (both in terms of the application as well as the application server&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which is <a href="http://glassfish.org">GlassFish v3</a>, of course&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that runs it).  When accessing the application, please keep in mind that it&#8217;s on an old server that&#8217;s running on an AT&amp;T U-verse line, and the download times will reflect that. :)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;d also like to not that this showcases a couple of new components at the moment.  I&#8217;ve begun an implementation of the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/">YUI data table widget</a>.  At the time of this posting, basic table functions work, including client-side sorting.  More complex functionality, such as Ajax updates, are in the offing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another new component, which the demo uses extensively, is the excellent <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/SyntaxHighlighter">SyntaxHighligher</a> script from Alex Gorbatchev.  The demo uses this new component to show the page source for each demo, finally allowing you to see a given component in action, as well seeing the page markup that makes those components.  The demo is still in flux, so some things aren&#8217;t quite "perfect" yet.  For example, Safari really hates the markup the demo produces, which is a bug in the demo application itself.  Hopefully, that will soon be fixed.  For now, Safari users will need to use another <a href="http://getfirefox.org">browser</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As I&#8217;ve noted, Scales has been migrated to JSF 2.  While most components are working as expected, there are likely some minor issues to work out.  If you run into any of these issues, or if you&#8217;d like to see extra functionality in any of the components, please feel free to file an issue on the Scales <a href="http://kenai.com/jira/browse/SCALES">issue tracker</a> on the Kenai project site.</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>While JSF has had Ajax support for a long time now, it has always been through external libraries such as <a href="http://www.jboss.org/richfaces">Ajax4Jsf/RichFaces</a>, <a href="http://www.icefaces.org/main/home/">ICEfaces</a>, <a href="http://directwebremoting.org/dwr/index.html">DWR</a>, <a href="https://jsf-extensions.dev.java.net/nonav/mvn/reference-ajax.html">DynaFaces</a>, etc.  With JSF 2, the framework now has first class, standardized support for Ajax.  This is good news on several fronts.  For those that want Ajax support but would rather not import another library, that capability is now baked in, and, for those familiar with a4j or DynaFaces, it should look very familiar.  However, for those that don&#8217;t mind the external dependency, the standardized Ajax will make it much easier to mix and match component libraries on the same page, an issue that has plagued JSF for while.  In this post, I&#8217;d like to take the first approach and show how easy it is to achieve Ajaxy updates on your <code>h:dataTable</code> using only standard JSF.</p>

        <a href="/2009/mojarra-scales-1-3-2-has-been-released">Mojarra Scales 1.3.2 Has Been Released</a>
        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>Late last night, I published Mojarra Scales 1.3.2.  This is mostly a bug and performance fix, but here are some highlights from the release:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>&lt;sc:links /&gt; (and related supporting classes and components) was modified to allow files <em>only</em> from /scales to fix a pretty glaring security hole in some scenarios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When multiple, local requests for a given resource type (CSS or JS) are queued, they are now rendered to the page in such a way that they will be returned in a single request.  That is to say, Mojarra Scales will now concatenate these files into one response, so as to reduce the number of network operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scales now correctly handles cached files.  When a CSS or JS resource is sent, Scales now employs etags to help the client cache the file properly.  On subsequent requests, if the client sends the last modified header, Scales properly handles the date, returning 304 when appropriate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&lt;tab/&gt; now supports the <code>style</code> and <code>styleClass</code> attributes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The multi-file upload component has been moved out of the main jar into its own artifact so that those not using the component will have a smaller deployment.  This component can be found under the upload <code>artifactId</code> in the <a href="http://download.java.net/maven/2/com/sun/mojarra/mojarra-scales-upload/">maven repository</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The jar files, including the demo app, can be downloaded from <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/scales/downloads/directory/Mojarra%20Scales%201.3.2">kenai.com</a> or via <a href="http://download.java.net/maven/2/com/sun/mojarra/mojarra-scales/">maven</a> (the demo is not in maven).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the architectural changes in 1.3 out of the way, the next version of Scales should include more components, as well as enhancements to existing components.  At some point, the project will be branched for a migration to JSF 2.  With the spec being final and Mojarra 2 scheduled to ship in a couple of weeks, it seems the time is right for the move.  Time will tell, of course, how soon that move is made.</p>

<p>Today we released FacesTester 0.2.  While this release has a number of bug fixes and more minor enhancements, one of the biggest new features is injection support. Leveraging the <code>InjectionProvider</code> Service Provider Interface (SPI) provided by Mojarra, FacesTester now supports the automagic injection of mock/test objects.  For example, the following managed bean:</p>

<p>I know you&#8217;re not supposed to do this, but sometimes it&#8217;s just easier.  Sometimes I use `table`s to layout out my forms.  Especially for big forms, it&#8217;s just easier to put things in a table than deal with `label`s, CSS, etc.  Right or wrong, I do it from time to time, but, thanks to <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jsf2fu1/index.html">David Geary</a>, I just learned that I make it harder on myself than it needs to be.  The sad thing is that I&#8217;ve known about this solution for years now, but never put two and two together.</p>

<p><strong>On May 19th</strong>, Pete Muir, JSF 2.0 Expert Group member and Web Beans implementation lead (if I recall correctly) will be leading, in conjunction with <a href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/TheAquarium/JCDI+-+JSR299">The Aquarium</a>, a <a href="http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/WebinarOnJSR299ContextsAndDependencyInjection">webinar</a> covering the forthcoming Java Contexts and Dependency Injection JSR (JSR-299, formerly known by the JSR&#8217;s former name, Web Beans).  Unfortunately, that&#8217;s right in the middle of the Oklahoma City JUG&#8217;s meeting, so I can&#8217;t make it, especially since I&#8217;m this month&#8217;s speaker.  For those of you that won&#8217;t be attending the OKC JUG tomorrow, this should be a good session on a great spec.  I hope to catch the recording.  Not as good as attending live, but it&#8217;s all I&#8217;ll be able to manage.</p>

<p>Early this morning, I published Mojarra Scales 1.3.1.  I&#8217;ve been remiss in making good updates where when I make release, so, rather than creating a new post for each release long after the fact, I&#8217;ll try to being everyone up to the current state in just one.</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the great strengths and successes, I think, of the JavaServer Faces specification is the proliferation of third party components.  One of the older and better known component sets is RichFaces, which started out under a company called Exadel and is now part of JBoss.  For many, RichFaces is the first add-on component set for a new JSF project, and with good reason.  I recently had the opportunity to serve as a technical reviewer on Max Katz&#8217;s <em><a href="http://apress.com/book/view/1430210559">Practical RichFaces</a></em> from Apress.

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>In my experience, a pretty common bug with custom components is improper state saving.  Since JSF components are, currently, stateful, it&#8217;s important that custom components integrate with the frameworks state saving mechanism correctly.  Unfortunately, it can be an error-prone process, as it&#8217;s a manual effort.  Now, however, custom component authors can use FacesTester to exercise this aspect of their components to help insure proper state handling.  This article will show how to use this new feature of FacesTester.</p>

<p>About a month ago, I <a href="/announcing-facestester/">announced</a> a new project, FacesTester, a JUnit-based testing tool for JSF that my good friend <a href="http://www.rodcoffin.com/">Rod Coffin</a> and I have undertaken.  Since then, Rod posted a very nice <a href="http://blog.rodcoffin.com/?p=137">introduction</a> to FacesTester usage.  Today, we made our first official release, FacesTester 0.1.  The version number should indicate that it&#8217;s still a work in progress, but it is already quite functional (I, for one, have been using it to build a test suite for Mojarra Scales, which has helped drive out features and resolve bugs very quickly).  We wanted to push out a release to encourage people to download it, use it, and give us feedback.</p>

<p>So what does FacesTester currently support?  Quite a bit.  In this entry, we&#8217;ll take a quick look at what FacesTester offers, and what we have planned.</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>The GlassFish webinar series is, I think,  a pretty valuable resource for regular readers of my blog, as it covers a lot of topics that I cover here.  Today&#8217;s <a href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/TheAquarium/ICEFaces+and+JSF2.0">webinar</a>, "From Ajax Push to JSF 2.0: ICEfaces on GlassFish," is particularly relevant, as it&#8217;s a JSF-related session.  Here&#8217;s the abstract:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ted will provide details on how to build and deploy rich web applications with Ajax and Ajax Push (aka Comet) and catch a glimpse of the future with an overview of JavaServer Faces 2.0.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This presentation illustrates the fundamentals of Ajax Push, covering application design, development, and deployment, drawing on ICEfaces sample applications and implementation. Topics will include network protocols, application-level push APIs, GlassFish Grizzly integration, and the ramifications of the two-connection limit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Looking forward to JSF 2.0, we will cover Ajax integration, new scopes and annotations, and custom components.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had the opportunity to see Ted present Ajax Push (their term for Reverse Ajax or Comet, if you prefer those monikers) at last year&#8217;s <a href="http://jsfone.com">JSFOne</a> conference.  The ICEfaces demos are very, very slick, and the level of simplicity they managed to achieve is absolutely amazing.  If you have any interest in Ajax Push/Reverse Ajax/Comet, you should certainly attend this session.  If you are currently using JSF, this is a really good example of the power of component-based frameworks like JSF.</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the issues that has always troubled me with regard to writing JSF applications (or <em>any</em> web application, really) is how hard it is to test them.  Some time ago, while discussing various Java web frameworks, I stumbled across a class called <code>WicketTester</code>, which is part of the Wicket project.  Using this class, as best as I can tell, Wicket authors can easily test their applications very quickly.  Having taken the advice of Dale Hanchey, and old <a href="http://www.okbu.edu">college</a> professor of mine, "Never be too proud to steal a good idea," FacesTester was born.</p>

<p>As I noted in a recent <a href="/posts/changes-are-coming-to-the-glassfish-admin-console">entry</a>, we are considering moving to a desktop-like interface for the GlassFish Administration Console, where the content is in separate "windows" (decorated DIVs, basically) which can be moved, closed, minimized, etc.  As I&#8217;ve started working on a concrete implementation of some of those ideas, I quickly realized that we were going to have issues with multiple, overlapping windows.  Once you have multiple windows open, the user has to be able to bring the desired window to the front, but YUI, which will likely be the library used, doesn&#8217;t support that natively.  Fortunately, that&#8217;s easy to fix.  First, an example of the problem:</p>

<p>I needed a break this afternoon, so I thought I&#8217;d see how easy it is to bootstrap a JSF 2 project.  One of the biggest complaints about JSF 1.x is all that XML, so JSF 2 is aiming to fix that.  How have we done so far?  Based on this quick look (which is my first from-scratch JSF 2 app), really, really well.</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;ve been following the evolution of the JSF 2 spec closely, you have probably seen the addition of a finer-grained event system (if you haven&#8217;t seen it, section 3.4 of the spec is the relevant one).  These events include things like AfterAddToViewEvent, BeforeRenderEvent, ViewMapCreatedEvent, etc.  An application developer could subscribe to these events from a managed bean by using the API exposed by the new system.  While that is a big improvement over the way things work in 1.2, it still leave page authors out in the cold until, that is, this week.  Yesterday I committed the code to support declarative even handling to Mojarra.  In this short entry, we&#8217;ll take a look at what that entails, and how to use it.</p>

<p>As the specification writing part of JSF 2 comes to a close, we&#8217;re getting a more complete implementation done on the reference implementation, Mojarra.  One of the primary developers on Mojarra is Jim Driscoll (the other being Ryan Lubke, who has done such an excellent job on the 1.2 series).  Jim, apparently, has been in a writing mood and has posted a number of very good (and small) posts on some of the features coming in JSF 2 (similar to Ryan&#8217;s <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/rlubke/">series</a> from earlier this year).</p>

<p>The JSF 2.0 Expert Group (operating under the auspices of <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=314">JSR 314</a>) has released Early Draft Review 1 of the upcoming revision of the spec.  We are soliciting feedback, of course, and the window of opportunity for that runs through July 2.  If you want to have some input on the direction of the specification, now is the time to speak up. :)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The major changes in this draft release are baked in Ajax support, and what we&#8217;ve termed "EZComp," which is better described as composite components.  Composite components, which touches on a change to finalized in a later release, namely, the inclusion of Facelets, allows a component developer to create a new component by piecing together several others in a template file.  This functionality is very similar, as best as I can tell as I&#8217;ve never used them, to Facelets' component support, where a snippet of markup is specified in a file and can then be treated as an actual component.  Unlike the Facelets version, though, these composite components are "real" components in that they are backed by a UIComponent.  If you were at JavaOne, this is what Ed demoed in this presentation (with Roger demonstrating the Ajax support).</p>

<p>There&#8217;s still much work to be done before September when we are schedule to deliver the Proposed Final Draft, but this is a pretty good start.

We really do want your input, as our goal is to improve upon the JSF experience and solve as many of the real world pain points as we can.

<p>Today, <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/rlubke/">Ryan Lubke</a> committed code to the Mojarra tree that will allow a JSF developer to prototype and/or develop just about every JSF artifact using <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a>.  When deployed to the server in development mode, the Groovy file can be changed on disk, and the changes will be picked up automatically, allowing one to avoid the compile/package/deploy cycle that can make Java web development so tedious.  Once the artifact is "done," the Groovy source can be copied to a Java source file and compiled (or the build process can compile the .groovy files to .class files) for production deployment.  This could be a really nice feature for component development, for example.</p>

<p>In a recent <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/robc/archive/2008/02/profiles_in_the_1.html">blog post</a>, Java EE 6 (JSR 316) specification co-lead Roberto Chinnici discussed the two leading proposals for the web profile in the upcoming Java EE 6 specification (For more information about profiles, one can start with <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/blogs/thread.tss?thread_id=48511">this article</a> on TheServerSide.)  The part that caught me by surprise and confuses me greatly is why the inclusion of JavaServer Faces in the web profile would be controversial.  Having spoken with an expert group member, who I will not out :), the argument comes down to this:  "We shouldn&#8217;t force a broken technology, that is not the clear winner on people."  I think that&#8217;s a very interesting statement, in that it precludes doing just about anything in the spec.</p>

If you are interested in learning more about what was done, and how you can apply the same techniques to your own JSF components, please see <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2EE/jsf_templating/index.html">this article</a>, written by <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/paulsen/">Ken Paulsen</a> and myself, with editing help from Rick Palkovic, which shows how one can use <a href="https://jsftemplating.dev.java.net">JSFTemplating</a> and some (currently "private") annotations from the <a href="https://woodstock.dev.java.net">Woodstock</a> project to greatly simplify JSF component authoring.

There are a few differences between the Sandbox of Scales to note, such as package names, namespace, etc.  There has also been a fair amount of refactoring inside the library to simplify the components somewhat (more on that later).

While the project itself is not new (it&#8217;s the same, high quality and stable JSF implementation we&#8217;re all familiar with ;), the announcement of the new moniker brings to an end a lengthy, and sometimes frustrating, process of deciding on a name that can pass legal muster.

<p>On a recent project, the architecture we settled on included JavaServer Faces (no surprise, there, I guess:), JBoss Seam and JPA.  The production environment is Oracle&#8217;s OC4J, so the stack we chose has to deploy (easily) to that container.  While I did get it working, it wasn&#8217;t easy, nor was it easily reproducible.  Now that the pressures of deadlines have passed, I took the time to track down what exactly needs to be done to make the application deploy and run on OC4J.  In retrospect, it doesn&#8217;t look that hard, but, knowing the pain I went through to make it work, I thought I&#8217;d share what you need to know if you&#8217;re in a similar situation.</p>

One of the coolest features, I think, is its introduction of templating events (e.g., one can attach a beforeEncode event to a component on a page and have a handler method fire before that component is encoded).  The first comment I hear, though, is usually something about template syntax, and it does seem a bit foreign with things like <code>&lt;!if $attribute{in} &amp; !

The solutions we&#8217;ve used have been less than exciting.  For the first problem, we&#8217;d make the backing bean that coordinates the PDF creation (calling the service layer, basically) session-scoped, then have a hidden iframe on the result page whose source is a JSP that pulls the bean out the session (via Java code!) and sends the PDF to the browser in such a way that forces the user to save the file.  For the upload issue, we&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://jupload.sourceforge.net">JUpload</a>, which works fine, but, since it lives outside the JSF lifecycle, we have to do some interesting things to make it work.  Luckily, my boss gave me time to create better solutions, resulting in the components <code>&lt;fl:download/&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;fl:multiFileUpload/&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re doing web development, you have likely at least heard of Ajax, and, if you&#8217;re not currently using it, you&#8217;ve likely investigated its possible use.  One of the tricky aspects of working with a technology like Ajax is integrating it with various frameworks.  JavaServer Faces, now a standard part of the Java EE stack, is no different.  For both a page and component author, the integration issue can be a big question.  Luckily for those of us in the JSF world, that question has been addressed by Chris Schalk and Ed Burns, in their new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaServer-Faces-Complete-Reference/dp/0072262400/ref=sr_11_1/104-8011241-4536743?ie=UTF8">JavaServer Faces:  The Complete Reference</a>.</p>

As I&#8217;ve prepared for that talk, I&#8217;ve thought quite a bit about the web apps I write, which are, for the most part, pretty boring.  I like to think that they&#8217;re functional, but I have to admit that they&#8217;re pretty plain. Ajax, though, along with the Javascript pretties that usually accompany an Ajaxified application, is a good way of fixing that "problem", assuming it&#8217;s done properly.  That line of thinking has affected how I&#8217;ve approached a new app I started at work, but finding a library that works well with JSF (read as, in a JSF-friendly manner) has been a bit of a challenge.</p>

<p>In my ongoing efforts to learn the JSF framework as thoroughly as possible, I decided to write a component, but, with the myriad of high quality components available, what was left for me to do? :P At the suggestion of my brother, who has been watching a similar effort underway in the <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net/">Wicket</a> space, I&#8217;ve decided to wrap Yahoo&#8217;s <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui">UI library</a>.  The problem I ran into pretty quickly, though, was that the documentation wasn&#8217;t too clear as to what I needed to make it happen (though it&#8217;s quite likely I was having an obtuse moment or three).  There are a plethora of resources that discuss what needs to be done, but all seemed either incomplete or too disjointed (see disclaimer above).  So, to help ameliorate that, let&#8217;s walk through wrapping Yahoo&#8217;s calendar component as a JSF component, step by step.  Before I go much further, though, I must note that I am by no means an expert in this, so it&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;re going to see some less than ideal examples.

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes, when developing a JSF application, it would be nice not to have to wait for your favorite container to start up.  That&#8217;s especially true if your container is a full JEE stack like GlassFish or JBoss.  Likewise, there are times when you might need to embed a web application in another, say some server process or desktop application.  While there are a number of options available, I&#8217;d like to demonstrate how to embed a simple JSF application using the <a href="http://winstone.sourceforge.net/">Winstone Servlet Container</a>.  To help demonstrate how this is done, we&#8217;ll use a well know sample application:  <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/GUI/JavaServerFaces/">Duke&#8217;s guessNumber game</a>, and, to make things even more interesting, we&#8217;ll convert the application to use Facelets (mostly because I love Facelets, but partly because I didn&#8217;t care to figure out how to make Winstone compile JSPs ;) ).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In one of our applications at work, we needed to be able to deep link to certain pages to allow external applications to get at specific pieces of data, product and order information to be specific.  Since JSF 1.x does not support HTTP GET requests, this poses a problem.  In order to get (no pun intended) information to the backing bean for processing, the data would have to be POSTed.  This obviously makes bookmarking the resulting page useless.  Our initial solution was to write a servlet filter which would get a reference to the current FacesContext, then get a reference to the appropriate JSF managed bean, and pump data into it.  This actually worked rather well, but, at Ed Burns' suggestion, I decided to reimplement this a JSF PhaseListener (many thanks to Ryan Lubke for his help!).  A PhaseListener is "an interface implemented by objects that wish to be notified at the beginning and ending of processing for each standard phase of the request processing lifecycle."</p>

<p>Recently at work, we looked, ever so briefly, at a new web framework called <a href="http://stripes.mc4j.org/confluence/display/stripes/Home">Stripes</a>.  It looked rather cool, as it was largely annotation-based, but, given its glaring lack of any wide-spread usage, we never seriously considered it.  Today, I was on <a href="http://www.theserverside.com">The Server Side</a> (you <strong><em>do</em></strong> read TSS, right? ;) ) and noticed that Struts has released a <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=39840">Java 5 addon</a>.  One of the additions is annotation support whose only problem appears to be that it&#8217;s tied to Struts (that&#8217;s a joke ;) ).</p>
