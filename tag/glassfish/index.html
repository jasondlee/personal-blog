        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>Recently, in the #glassfish channel on Freenode, a user was having trouble configuring GlassFish in a Docker environment. He was scripting the configuration
of the server, but was having trouble setting the admin user&#8217;s password, since the <code>change-admin-password</code> command takes input from <code>stdin</code>.
Fortunately, there&#8217;s REST API for that. This <code>curl</code> command will do what the user needs to do without any need for additional input:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the password is set, this same command can be used to change the password, but <code>--user admin:$PASSWORD</code> must be added to authenticate
the request.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I should note that I don&#8217;t think this is an officially supported way to execute asadmin commands. It works, but it may change, or it may go away.
I would say that Oracle may not support doing this either, but they don&#8217;t offer <em>any</em> support, so there&#8217;s no harm there. :) Also note that
<code>AS_ADMIN_PASWORD</code> has a typo in it that may be fixed in future releases of the server. Caveat emptor! :)</p>

<p>Wikipedia defines Server-Sent Events as "a technology for providing push notifications from a server to a browser client in the form of DOM events. The Server-Sent Events EventSource API is now being standardized as part of HTML5 by the W3C."  It&#8217;s a great alternative to polling the server for updates.  Long story short, thanks to the work of the <a href="http://jersey.java.net">Jersey</a> team, we have "easy" access to this in GlassFish, and we&#8217;ve added support for it to our RESTful administration interface.  Let&#8217;s take a look at a quick sample.</p>

<p>I recently blogged about a change we made in GlassFish 3.1.2 with regard to REST security.  Specifically, we added some CSRF protection (you can read the details <a href="/posts/2012/03/01/glassfish-3-1-2-and-rest-security">here</a>).

<p>As you may know by now, we <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/theaquarium/entry/glassfish_3_1_2_final">released GlassFish</a> 3.1.2 yesterday.  Tim Quinn has a nice <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/quinn/entry/a_few_changes_to_secure">overview</a> of some of the security-related changes, but one change he didn&#8217;t cover was one in the RESTful administration area, namely CSRF protection. I won&#8217;t go into the details of what <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CSRF">CSRF attack</a> is here, but I do want to show we&#8217;ve added protections to GlassFish to make sure the server is as secure as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the curious, we implemented the CSRF protection using a <a href="http://jersey.java.net/nonav/apidocs/latest/jersey/com/sun/jersey/api/container/filter/CsrfProtectionFilter.html">filter</a> provided by the <a href="http://jersey.java.net">Jersey</a> team.  As you can see from the javadoc, this change only affects requests that change state (POST, PUT, DELETE, etc).
To update your client code, all you need to do is add the <code>X-Requested-By</code> header.  Its value doesn&#8217;t matter:</p>

<p>As I&#8217;ve covered here before, GlassFish sports (and has for a while now), a pretty comprehensive set of management and monitoring REST endpoints.  While this goes a long way toward opening up GlassFish management to various scripting solutions, the client side is still pretty manual.  One my goals in GlassFish 4.0 is to fix that.  In this article, I&#8217;m going to give you a sneak peak into what we on the REST team have planned for the GlassFish RESTful administration interface.</p>

<p>image::http://glassfish.java.net/image/sparky_3.1_orange.gif[style="float: right; padding: 0px 0px 10px 10px;"] For those that may not have noticed, today the GlassFish team officially released version 3.1.  This new release brings in a myriad of features, the most significant of which is probably clustering and high availability.  <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/theaquarium/entry/glassfish_3_1_is_here">The Aquarium</a> is the best place to find links to blogs, screencasts etc. from various GlassFish engineers (though Markus Eisele has a nice run down of the new features <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2011/02/glassfish-31-arrived-yes-sir-we-do.html">here</a> as well).  The Aquarium&#8217;s list is pretty extensive, so certainly check it out, but I&#8217;d like to highlight a few that I found interesting from teammates of mine:</p>

<p>People often ask what the difference is between the free GlassFish and the commercially-supported version.  The answer really is "not much" in terms of the core server itself (pretty much just branding changes).  The commercial version, though, has some nice value-add features, such as the <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jenblog/entry/performance_tuner_in_oracle_glassfish">Performance Tuner</a>, amongst others.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really, really pleased with how GlassFish 3.1 has turned out.  We still (and will always) have more work to do, but this is a solid release that finally fills in some enterprise holes that v3 didn&#8217;t have time to fill.  Download it, install it, kick the tires a bit, and tell us what you what <a href="http://java.net/jira/browse/GLASSFISH">you think</a>.

<p>From time to time, I&#8217;m asked about accessing various EE artifacts (EJBs, etc) from a standalone client.  Almost invariably, the user is having trouble getting the environment setup, grabbing an InitialContext, etc.  Also almost invariably, my answer to them is "use the application client container", which is as far as I can take them.  The topic of application client container, or ACC, came up again recently when I was asked on Twitter about an issue with ACC and GlassFish in a clustered environment. While this user (hi, Markus! : ) <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2011/02/clustering-stateful-session-beans-with.html">figured out his issue</a> before I could be of much help, I took this opportunity finally to learn exactly what the ACC is and how to use it.

In production, of course, the server will be secured, which means our client code will have to be modified.  In this installment, we&#8217;ll see how that might be done in Java.</p>

In a general sense, this is a pretty easy question to answer, but I&#8217;ve run into situations where the reports take a long time to run&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and I&#8217;m sure she will, as well&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;making a web interface for generating the report less useful (due to timeouts, etc).

The blog <a href="http://buytaert.net/mollom-gets-a-new-backend">post</a>, though, immediately made me think of dynamic languages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These days, it&#8217;s hot to be dynamic, whether it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>, <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a>, or something else.  There&#8217;s no denying that they have some very compelling features.  One of the quotes in the blog post, though, really stood out to me:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With our move to GlassFish, we&#8217;ll have to worry a lot less about memory management, REST handling, XML parsing, database connection pooling, and all the other ancillary things that make big systems work. That frees us up to focus on the domain-specific problems&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the actual moving parts of Mollom itself&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and will help both support our growth and allow us to implement new features and improve the old ones.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As I&#8217;ve noted, their former architecture was Java-based, but the same idea applies to the typical deployment of projects based on dynamic languages.  While readily admitting I&#8217;ve done precious little with dynalang projects in the enterprise, from what I&#8217;ve read and have heard people discuss, it seems the most common deployment scenario is, for example, Apache httpd with mod_foo installed.  There might even be a cluster of these httpd instances (or some other web server that a language or framework suggests) behind a load balancer or two, and that seems to work for a lot of people.  While effective, though, it seems that such a configuration leaves a lot of grunt infrastructure work up to the development or production support team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enter the Java EE stack.  As the Mollom engineer noted, using an application server like GlassFish gives the developer and support teams quite a bit of infrastructure for free.  In addition to what he listed, a full EE stack can also give you clustering/high-availability, monitoring, server management, etc. (Note: GlassFish v2 support all of these.  GlassFish v3 does not support clustering, but GlassFish 3.1, which is just about ready to ship, will).  Many of the "ancillary things that make big systems work" are provided for you.  It&#8217;s not free, of course.  The system demands are typically higher, and those "ancillary things" have to be configured, tuned and monitored, but they don&#8217;t have to be developed, which makes the systems that run on them a fair bit simpler.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is possible, of course, to get the best of both worlds.  Some dynamic languages, like <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a>, already run on the JVM, while projects like <a href="http://jruby.org/">JRuby</a> and <a href="http://jython.org/">Jython</a> allow running those languages in a Java EE container, all while still reaping the benefits that dynamic languages offer.  For shops that using those languages, or would like to, this is a very compelling option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dynamic languages do offer a lot that we Java developers would love to use, but users of those dynamic languages would be well-served to take a good look at the Java EE stack and see if perhaps Java can add value to their deployment.</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>Of the many great things about GlassFish, one that is often mentioned most (and is, in fact, what got me involved with GlassFish as an end user years ago) is the Administration Console.  It&#8217;s an extremely powerful and capable interface, and is, if I may be so bold, orders of magnitudes better than its open source competition (it may even beat commercial competitors, but I have no experience with those).  Another powerful tool in GlassFish administration is the asadmin CLI utility, which allows for quick and easy scripting of server provisioning, etc.  Did you know, though, that GlassFish has a third administration interface?  As of GlassFish v3, we offer a RESTful administration API, based on Jersey, to allow non-Java clients to configure the app server easily.  For GlassFish 3.1, one of my main responsibilities, with the help, I should add of my coworkers Ludovic Champenois and Mitesh Meswani, has been to help improve upon the great start we had in in v3.  In this entry, we&#8217;ll take a look at the current state of the interface and learn the basics of using.</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a little late notice, but we at Sun are holding a "virtual conference" covering GlassFish v3, Java EE 6, etc.  You can find details <a href="http://www.sun.com/events/javaee6glassfishv3/virtualconference/?cid=928443r2">here</a>.  It starts in 30 minutes (10:00 CST, 8:00 PST). :)</p>

    <li>
        <a href="/2009/glassfish-v3-is-now-available">GlassFish v3 Is Now Available</a>
        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>Today, the GlassFish team is pleased to announce the release of GlassFish v3.  This release marks the first production-ready release of a Java EE 6 compliant application server.  It also marks the culmination of a tremendous engineering effort to transform the very capable but monolithic GlassFish v2 into a small, sleek and scalable modular system, built on OSGi.  You can get all the details over at <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/theaquarium/entry/glassfish_v3_is_now_available">The Aquarium</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/anilam/entry/10_new_features_in_glassfish">all the features</a> in this release, the two I&#8217;m the proudest of are the console, on which I work during the day, and JSF 2, on which I work when I can.  The console, while it looks similar to that in v2 (somewhat by design), has undergone a pretty serious makeover.  We&#8217;ve removed the frameset, which solved a number of issues on both the client and the server, we introduced the use of the YUI LayoutManager to help with the page layout, and we implemented <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/paulsen/entry/the_ajax_experiment">Ajax-based navigation</a> (which was one of my major tasks, along with Ken Paulsen).  The result is, I think, a lighter, faster console.  It posed some interesting challenges, but I think we were able to work everything out to make a very nice and snappy console.  We&#8217;re not resting on our laurels, though.  Like the rest of the server, our team has some grand plans for upcoming releases in the console.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the backend, we had to do a fair amount of rework to accomadate all the changes made to support the modularity introduced for v3.  For example, as we demonstrated at a Hands-on-Lab at JavaOne, the console is pluggable, which allows developers, OEMs, admins, etc to create and install plugins that add functionality to the console.  In fact, that&#8217;s how we delivered all of the non-core functionality in the console.  If you&#8217;re running the web profile, you won&#8217;t see anything JMS-related, for instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other feature I&#8217;m pretty proud of is JSF 2.  As an Expert Group member and sadly not-too-active-committer (at the moment) on Mojarra, the JSF implementation we ship with GlassFish, I&#8217;m really, really pleased with how JSF 2 turned out.  In what spare time I can find, I&#8217;ve been doing some application development as well as component development using the new spec, and it&#8217;s been a joy to work with.  From annotations to composite components and more, JSF 2 is just really easy to work with (I hope to blog more on that in the near future).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to those, v3 offers CDI (via Weld), JPA 2, EJB 3.1, Servlet 3.0, and on and on.  There should be something for everyone, so do yourself a favor and check it out.  I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll be disappointed.</p>

<p>During the GlassFish v3 Prelude development cycle, the GlassFish team launched an initiative called FishCAT, which is our Community Acceptance Testing program.  The program was very successful for Prelude, resulting in many, many reported (and fixed! : ) issues for the Prelude release.  As we press hard toward the release of GlassFish v3 final later this fall, this program has been re-launched to help us engage our user community.  Through this program, testers will have a much greater impact on the final quality of the product when it finally ships.

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>The GlassFish webinar series is, I think,  a pretty valuable resource for regular readers of my blog, as it covers a lot of topics that I cover here.  Today&#8217;s <a href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/TheAquarium/ICEFaces+and+JSF2.0">webinar</a>, "From Ajax Push to JSF 2.0: ICEfaces on GlassFish," is particularly relevant, as it&#8217;s a JSF-related session.  Here&#8217;s the abstract:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ted will provide details on how to build and deploy rich web applications with Ajax and Ajax Push (aka Comet) and catch a glimpse of the future with an overview of JavaServer Faces 2.0.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This presentation illustrates the fundamentals of Ajax Push, covering application design, development, and deployment, drawing on ICEfaces sample applications and implementation. Topics will include network protocols, application-level push APIs, GlassFish Grizzly integration, and the ramifications of the two-connection limit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Looking forward to JSF 2.0, we will cover Ajax integration, new scopes and annotations, and custom components.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had the opportunity to see Ted present Ajax Push (their term for Reverse Ajax or Comet, if you prefer those monikers) at last year&#8217;s <a href="http://jsfone.com">JSFOne</a> conference.  The ICEfaces demos are very, very slick, and the level of simplicity they managed to achieve is absolutely amazing.  If you have any interest in Ajax Push/Reverse Ajax/Comet, you should certainly attend this session.  If you are currently using JSF, this is a really good example of the power of component-based frameworks like JSF.</p>

<p>GlassFish isn&#8217;t just an application server.  It&#8217;s a community.  For that reason, we on the admin console team want to take some time to run some ideas by the user community.  For the GlassFish v3 final release due in the middle of next year, we plan to redesign the admin console.  Since the admin console is usually high on the list of differentiators, we are approaching these changes very cautiously, as we don&#8217;t want to ruin a good thing.  Our goals are to make the console lighter and faster, and use a more modern design.  Our plan, then has several parts, which we&#8217;ll look at individually.</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>Jim Driscoll wrote a really helpful <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/driscoll/archive/2008/06/writing_a_littl.html">blog entry</a> regarding the GlassFish Update Center module he wrote for Mojarra.  After reading that, I decided to revisit <a href="/glassfish-php-and-wordpress/">Quercus on GlassFish</a>.  Using Jim&#8217;s incredibly detailed entry, as well as looking at the code in the Mojarra 2.0 SVN repo, I was able to get an Update Center module working that installs and configures Quercus for you, so now all you have to do to get WordPress running, <a href="http://blogs.steeplesoft.com/glassfish-php-and-wordpress/">for example</a>, is install this module, and extract WordPress into your document.  Easy!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For those interested, the Update Center url is <a href="http://uc.steeplesoft.com/quercus.xml" class="bare">http://uc.steeplesoft.com/quercus.xml</a>.  To set this up, you&#8217;ll need to start the Update Center ($GF_HOME/updatecenter/bin/updatetool.*), switch to the Preferences tab, click Add, and fill out the form.  Once that&#8217;s done, switch to the "Available Software" tab, click the "Check for Updates" button in the upper right corner, and wait for the process to finish.  You should now see Quercus available under the "Web Technologies" section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For those interested, the source code is in my Mercurial repository <a href="http://hg.steeplesoft.com/quercus_updatecenter">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to some issues in GlassFish v2, automatic uninstallation is a bit complicated.  The module supports it, but you have to get your hands dirty to make it work.  Jim has details on his blog.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you use this, please let me know how it works out for you.  :)</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>With all the hype around JRuby, Jython, Scala, Groovy, etc., an oft-overlooked dynamic language with JVM support is PHP.  Thanks to the hard work of the folks at Caucho Technology, the Quercus project offers a pure Java implementation of the PHP language, sporting support for a lot of the major PHP-based applications.  In this entry, we&#8217;ll look at how to configure GlassFish to provide easy PHP support, and then look at installing WordPress, the popular blogging software (which runs this site) on GlassFish.</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>As I&#8217;ve <a href="/2007/06/07/a-quick-administrative-note/">noted previously</a>, a recent job change has required that I become familiar with Oracle&#8217;s application server, Oracle Containers for Java, or OC4J.  I recently set aside time to set up my OC4J environment to test a prototype I have been working on and have running under GlassFish.  After getting the server installed and logging on to the administration console, I was struck by how nice it was.  I&#8217;ve long held that one of the many strengths GlassFish has over its open source competition is a vastly superior administration console.  Presented now with a commercial application server with the might of a company like Oracle behind it, how well does GlassFish stand up<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a>?  In this entry, I&#8217;d like to take a look at that question.  Since a Java EE container is a complicated piece of software, an exhaustive comparison of any two such containers is an overwhelming task.  In the interest of brevity, we&#8217;ll take a look at just a couple of areas<a href="#footnote-2"><sup>2</sup></a>, and wrap things up with some general observations.</p>

<p>While many have found GlassFish to be a great choice for an internal application server, there are others that would like to push it a bit further, and use it in an ASP/ISP envrionment.  Jan Luehe discussed GlassFish&#8217;s virtual hosting features in a recent <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jluehe/entry/virtual_hosting_features_in_glassfish">blog entry</a>.  What I&#8217;d like to do in this entry is take the information that Jan presented, and walk through setting up a few different virtual hosting environments.</p>
