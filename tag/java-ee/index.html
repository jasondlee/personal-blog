        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>Many times, one of the hardest parts of getting started with a particular piece of technology is figuring out how to get
started. :) In this series, I&#8217;ve used an <em>extremely</em> simple project to show how to do just that with a number of MicroProfile
implementations. Obviously, a real application will have many more concerns than we dealt with in this application, but
what this effort gave us is working, runnable, and  testable build for six different MicroProfile implementations. What
I&#8217;d like to do in this final installment in the series, is give some closing thoughts.</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>Up next in our series comes an offering from, to me, a somewhat surprising source, Oracle, and that offering is
<a href="https://helidon.io/">Helidon</a>. I first heard about in
<a href="https://medium.com/oracledevs/helidon-takes-flight-fb7e9e390e9c">September 2018</a>, and while it&#8217;s still pre-1.0, it
looks extremely promising.</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>This time around, we&#8217;re going to start looking at a slightly different take on MicroProfile implemenations. Whereas
Payara Micro, Thorntail, OpenLibery, and TomEE are all based on application servers (albeit stripped down versions), our
implementation in this post, <a href="https://hammock-project.github.io/">Hammock</a>, is based on a CDI container. Rather than start
what amounts to an app server under which a web is deployed, we&#8217;ll be spinning up a plain ol' CDI container, which will
look for CDI beans to load/start/etc. That may sound weird, and I may not be describing it clearly, so let&#8217;s just jump in
to the code and take a look.</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>In this installment of our series, we&#8217;re going to take a look at the last of what I think of as the more traditional,
app-server-based/-spawned implementations, <a href="http://tomee.apache.org">TomEE</a>. TomEE is a fully Java EE-enabled distribution
of the venerable workhorse Tomcat, and comes with support for creating MicroProfile applications, so let&#8217;s see what that
looks like.</p>

we&#8217;ll take a look at <a href="http://openliberty.io">OpenLiberty</a> this time. OpenLiberty is the open source project
under which, as I understand the state of things, IBM&#8217;s WebSphere Liberty is developed. In this installment, we&#8217;ll
give its MicroProfile support a quick spin.</p>

<p>In the last <a href="/posts/2018/getting-started-with-eclipse-microprofile-part-2-payara-micro.html">installment</a>, we talked about
Payara Micro. In this, we&#8217;re going to look at <a href="https://thorntail.io/">Thorntail</a>. Thorntail, n√©e WildFly Swarm, is based
on WildFly from Red Hat and is said to be "just enough app-server". Much like Payara Micro, Thorntail exposes a
battle-tested application server platform, stripped down for microservices usage. Let&#8217;s a take a look at what it takes
to deploy our application on Thorntail.</p>

<p><a href="http://payara.fish/software/payara-server/payara-micro/">Payara Micro</a> is a MicroProfile implementation from the good folks at Payara, based on Payara Server, which is itself

Micro.</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>To start our investigation, we need an application to work with. Part of the problem with getting started
applications is making sure that your example is complicated enough to be interesting, but not so complicated that
the greater message is lost in the details of the app. MicroProfile 2.0 is made up of a number of components:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>MicroProfile Config 1.3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MicroProfile Fault Tolerance 1.1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MicroProfile Health Check 1.0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MicroProfile JWT Authentication 1.1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MicroProfile Metrics 1.1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MicroProfile OpenAPI 1.0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MicroProfile OpenTracing 1.1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MicroProfile Rest Client 1.1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CDI 2.0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Common Annotations 1.3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JAX-RS 2.1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JSON-B 1.0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JSON-P 1.1</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To include <strong>all</strong> of those in this would probably be a bit too much technical weight for a getting started effort, so,
for this example, I&#8217;ve leaned (probably too far) toward simple. Our application will have a single JAX-RS resource, into
which is injected a single CDI bean. The point is to have a working REST endpoint, with an inject "service layer", to show
a MicroProfile in action, allowing us to verify that our basic environment is configured and working correctly. From there
you are free to load on all the complexity you find you need. That&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;ll be doing in a separate project. :)</p>

<p><span class="image right"><img src="/images/2018/microprofile_logo.jpg" alt="microprofile logo"></span>
The <a href="http://microprofile.io">Eclipse MicroProfile</a> is a community-driven profile initially developed by Red Hat, IBM,
TomiTribe, Payara and the London Java Community (LJC).
<a href="https://microprofile.io/2016/06/29/announcing-java-ee-microprofile/">Launched in 2016</a>, it was intended to sit alongside
Java EE&#8217;s Web and Full profiles, offering Java EE developers a smaller, lighter set of standards with which they could
build microservices. Today, MicroProfile lives as an Eclipse project, and is being supported and actively developed by
its creators as well as many more, including both corporations and individuals, giving us an embarassment of riches, if
you will, when it comes to implementations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By my count, there are at least 6 implementations from which to choose,
leading to the question: Which one do I choose? While there are many aspects that factor in to such a decision, it is not
my intent here to answer those questions. Rather, what I&#8217;d like to do is provided some small "getting started" projects
to help you kick off your own investigation. With that in mind, here are the implementations (in no particular order)
that we&#8217;re going to look at:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://payara.fish/software/payara-server/payara-micro/">Payara Micro</a></p>
</li>

<p><a href="https://helidon.io/">Helidon</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="/posts/2018/getting-started-with-eclipse-microprofile-part-1-the-app.html">Part 1</a>, we&#8217;ll cover the (admittedly absurdly basic) application, and in subsequent parts, we&#8217;ll see what it takes
to deploy that application using each of these MicroProfile implementations.</p>

<p>Wikipedia defines Server-Sent Events as "a technology for providing push notifications from a server to a browser client in the form of DOM events. The Server-Sent Events EventSource API is now being standardized as part of HTML5 by the W3C."  It&#8217;s a great alternative to polling the server for updates.  Long story short, thanks to the work of the <a href="http://jersey.java.net">Jersey</a> team, we have "easy" access to this in GlassFish, and we&#8217;ve added support for it to our RESTful administration interface.

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>image::http://glassfish.java.net/image/sparky_3.1_orange.gif[style="float: right; padding: 0px 0px 10px 10px;"] For those that may not have noticed, today the GlassFish team officially released version 3.1.  This new release brings in a myriad of features, the most significant of which is probably clustering and high availability.  <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/theaquarium/entry/glassfish_3_1_is_here">The Aquarium</a> is the best place to find links to blogs, screencasts etc. from various GlassFish engineers (though Markus Eisele has a nice run down of the new features <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2011/02/glassfish-31-arrived-yes-sir-we-do.html">here</a> as well).  The Aquarium&#8217;s list is pretty extensive, so certainly check it out, but I&#8217;d like to highlight a few that I found interesting from teammates of mine:</p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People often ask what the difference is between the free GlassFish and the commercially-supported version.  The answer really is "not much" in terms of the core server itself (pretty much just branding changes).  The commercial version, though, has some nice value-add features, such as the <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jenblog/entry/performance_tuner_in_oracle_glassfish">Performance Tuner</a>, amongst others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m really, really pleased with how GlassFish 3.1 has turned out.  We still (and will always) have more work to do, but this is a solid release that finally fills in some enterprise holes that v3 didn&#8217;t have time to fill.  Download it, install it, kick the tires a bit, and tell us what you what <a href="http://java.net/jira/browse/GLASSFISH">you think</a>.  In the meantime, we&#8217;re going to go ahead and get started on 3.2.</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>From time to time, I&#8217;m asked about accessing various EE artifacts (EJBs, etc) from a standalone client.  Almost invariably, the user is having trouble getting the environment setup, grabbing an InitialContext, etc.  Also almost invariably, my answer to them is "use the application client container", which is as far as I can take them.  The topic of application client container, or ACC, came up again recently when I was asked on Twitter about an issue with ACC and GlassFish in a clustered environment. While this user (hi, Markus! : ) <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2011/02/clustering-stateful-session-beans-with.html">figured out his issue</a> before I could be of much help, I took this opportunity finally to learn exactly what the ACC is and how to use it.  Thanks to Oracle&#8217;s Tim Quinn for his patient and tireless help, here&#8217;s what I learned&#8230;&#8203;</p>

<ul>
    
    <li>
        <a href="/2010/the-value-of-the-stack">The Value of the Stack</a>
        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>This morning on twitter, I saw an <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/johanvos/status/14692015212068865">announcement</a> that <a href="http://mollom.com/">Mollom</a> has a new backend, one based on <a href="http://glassfish.org">GlassFish</a>.  I have to be honest.  I don&#8217;t know much of anything about Mollom beyond this, nor do I know anything about their previous backend other than it was Java-based.  The blog <a href="http://buytaert.net/mollom-gets-a-new-backend">post</a>, though, immediately made me think of dynamic languages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These days, it&#8217;s hot to be dynamic, whether it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>, <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a>, or something else.  There&#8217;s no denying that they have some very compelling features.  One of the quotes in the blog post, though, really stood out to me:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With our move to GlassFish, we&#8217;ll have to worry a lot less about memory management, REST handling, XML parsing, database connection pooling, and all the other ancillary things that make big systems work. That frees us up to focus on the domain-specific problems&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the actual moving parts of Mollom itself&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and will help both support our growth and allow us to implement new features and improve the old ones.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As I&#8217;ve noted, their former architecture was Java-based, but the same idea applies to the typical deployment of projects based on dynamic languages.  While readily admitting I&#8217;ve done precious little with dynalang projects in the enterprise, from what I&#8217;ve read and have heard people discuss, it seems the most common deployment scenario is, for example, Apache httpd with mod_foo installed.  There might even be a cluster of these httpd instances (or some other web server that a language or framework suggests) behind a load balancer or two, and that seems to work for a lot of people.  While effective, though, it seems that such a configuration leaves a lot of grunt infrastructure work up to the development or production support team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enter the Java EE stack.  As the Mollom engineer noted, using an application server like GlassFish gives the developer and support teams quite a bit of infrastructure for free.  In addition to what he listed, a full EE stack can also give you clustering/high-availability, monitoring, server management, etc. (Note: GlassFish v2 support all of these.  GlassFish v3 does not support clustering, but GlassFish 3.1, which is just about ready to ship, will).  Many of the "ancillary things that make big systems work" are provided for you.  It&#8217;s not free, of course.  The system demands are typically higher, and those "ancillary things" have to be configured, tuned and monitored, but they don&#8217;t have to be developed, which makes the systems that run on them a fair bit simpler.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is possible, of course, to get the best of both worlds.  Some dynamic languages, like <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a>, already run on the JVM, while projects like <a href="http://jruby.org/">JRuby</a> and <a href="http://jython.org/">Jython</a> allow running those languages in a Java EE container, all while still reaping the benefits that dynamic languages offer.  For shops that using those languages, or would like to, this is a very compelling option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dynamic languages do offer a lot that we Java developers would love to use, but users of those dynamic languages would be well-served to take a good look at the Java EE stack and see if perhaps Java can add value to their deployment.</p>
