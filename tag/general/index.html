<ul>
    
    <li>
        <a href="/2020/best-advice">Best Advice I've Been Given: Check Your Ego</a>
        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>The Red Hat twitter account just asked this <a href="https://twitter.com/RedHat/status/1225075337878495232">question</a>: "Communities grow by uplifting
others. What is one piece of advice you&#8217;d offer to a new developer? Reply below and then check out some advice from #RedHatter
<a href="https://twitter.com/somalley108">@somalley108</a>." Here&#8217;s my input.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a general rule, if you&#8217;re writing software, you&#8217;re probably pretty intelligent. That intelligence, while important, of course, can
also become a hindrance. For example, I&#8217;ve been told by coworkers, "You may write buggy code, but I don&#8217;t" and "We don&#8217;t need techincal oversight". I
think both of those statements are patently false, and they&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and others like them&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;always take me back to that advice from my first
manager, Chris Anderson, gave me way back in 1997:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Check your ego at the door.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s really easy to walk in to a coding review, a design session, or one of a myriad of other meetings with your ideas and think they&#8217;re the
best. It&#8217;s also really easy to overlook the fact that other people in that room are also pretty intelligent&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;maybe even more so (it happens),
and that we all have blindspots and weaknesses. In my experience, and I&#8217;ve certainly been on both sides more than I care to admit, many conflicts
in software development are ego-driven. There&#8217;s a difference between being passionate about something and being an arrogant jerk. The latter
type does nobody any good, so check your ego. Go in humbly, and see what there is to learn from your coworkers, even if you&#8217;re more senior than
they. With that mindset, everyone will come out a winner.</p>

<ul>

        <a href="/2017/chestertons-fence-and-the-software-developer">Chesterton's Fence and the Software Developer</a>
        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>Recently at work, we found an odd scenario with a REST (-ish ;) endpoint from another team:
If the request provided a list of, say, 11 IDs in the query string, the system would only return information on
the first 10 of them, silently dropping anything over that seemingly odd limit. The initial reaction was
of, course, "Well, let&#8217;s just increase the limit." To be honest, I had the same reaction, but
then I remembered one of my favorite quotes, known as Chesteron&#8217;s Fence:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple
principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a
certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a
road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, "I don&#8217;t see the use of this;
let us clear it away." To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer:
 "If you don&#8217;t see the use of it, I certainly won&#8217;t let you clear it away. Go away and think.
 Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it."</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; G.K. Chesterton
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Chesterton&#8217;s context, politics in Great Britain of the 1920s, is, of course, quite different from a software
development shop almost 100 years later, but the message is still extremely appropriate: Before
you go tearing things down or otherwise changing something you&#8217;ve found, you really need to understand not
only what you&#8217;re changing, but <em>why</em> it was made that way in the first place.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the case of this REST call, we should ask questions like</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Are there system load concerns, such as memory or processing time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there concerns about the on-the-wire response size?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was there an explicit Product Management decision to set the limit this low for business reasons we don&#8217;t see reflected in the code?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And so on. Until we can answer those questions (or reasonably rule them out as
irrelevant), we need to be very hesitant in making the change. Once we&#8217;ve explained the
original developer(s) built that fence, then we can talk about ripping it down.</p>

<p>Last summer, I put up a quick entry about <a href="/posts/2012/07/16/a-new-way-to-blog/">a new way to blog</a>, which I&#8217;ve enjoyed using. After suffering through yet another Wordpress security breach (which I&#8217;ll admit might be partly my fault through how I have my site set up and "maintained"), I&#8217;ve decided to take the next logical step and just move the whole thing to <a href="http://awestruct.org/">Awestruct</a>.  Overall, it&#8217;s been an enjoyable process, but it has certainly had it&#8217;s bumps and bruises.

<p>I&#8217;ll have more to say in the coming days about with it took, what I&#8217;ve learned, etc., but I wanted to post a quick note letting both of my readers know about the change. You should find the site faster, as it&#8217;s all static now, and much smaller (e.g., 16KB vs 47KB for the front page). Should you notice any issues, please let me know, as I still have a bit of cleaning up to do (e.g., images in older posts, implementing comments, etc). For now, though, enjoy the site. :)</p>

Since the cable companies are offering telephone, it seems the phone companies are now offering television, with everyone in on this internet thing.

    <li>
        <a href="/2007/rich-web-experience-day-3">Rich Web Experience, Day 3</a>
        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>The third and final day of the Rich Web Experience has come and gone. Today&#8217;s schedule is a bit lighter, with two morning sessions, a keynote at lunch, and workshops in the afternoon, leaving us finished (and done with the conference : ) just before dinner.  To be honest, I was a bit distracted this morning, as the <a href="http://www.soonersports.com/">Sooners</a> were busy <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=maisel_ivan&amp;id=3010576&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=NCFHeadlines">shellacking</a> Miami.  Though I couldn&#8217;t watch it on TV, I <em>did</em> have <a href="http://cbs.sportsline.com/collegefootball/gamecenter/preview/NCAAF_20070908_MIA@OK">cbsportsline.com</a> open so I could see live stats.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite the distraction, though, I really enjoyed Nicholas Zakas' talk on "Enterprise JavaScript Error Handling."  He started off by telling us that the only difference between enterprise JavaScript error handling and JavaScript error handling is that you can&#8217;t give a talk on JavaScript error handling. :)  After the bad joke, he showed some pretty novel ways of handling errors, and even getting those errors logged to the same place the server errors are by using an <code>img</code> tag.  He is a very eloquent and entertaining speaker, and, for me at least, very effective.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next up, I sat in on Joe Walker&#8217;s talk on <a href="http://getahead.org/dwr">DWR</a>.  Since I&#8217;ve used DWR quite a bit, there was a fair amount of review, but Joe&#8217;s section on Reverse Ajax was new to me, and really, really cool.  Joe&#8217;s passion and acumen certainly shone not only in this session, but in his participation on the expert panel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After lunch and a keynote by Eric Miller, it was off to a performance workshop with a couple of people from the Yahoo! <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/">Exceptional Performance</a> team.  Steve Souders and Tenni Theurer discussed various ways to increase web site performance (including pipelining, using sprites, and locating CSS and JS imports strategically), the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/">YSlow</a> <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> plugin, and then walked through the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html">rules</a> that YSlow helps a page author enforce.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As much as I enjoyed the conference, I&#8217;d have to say I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s over.  The NFJS team crammed so much into this weekend that I don&#8217;t think I could have taken much more.  Apparently, even though my wife wonders some times, I actually do have a threshold for that kind of thing, and the RWE got dangerously close to finding it.  It was a great conference, though, and I highly recommend it.  Next year, they&#8217;re going to try to do one "on each coast" with the plans being one in San Jose again, and the other, tentatively, in Atlanta.  It&#8217;s definitely worth the money, and I&#8217;m not just saying that because I won an iPhone. :)</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>Day two of RWE turned out to be as good as the first.  I started the day with two back-to-back talks on the Google Web Toolkit given by David Geary.  Just as entertaining and informative as his JSF talks from yesterday.  He describes GWT as (roughly) "the coolest piece of software I have ever seen" and it <em>is</em> pretty cool.  I&#8217;m still not sold on it, though, largely for the same reason I don&#8217;t like some other Java web frameworks:  I don&#8217;t think Java code is the best way to express a UI; I much prefer a domain specific language for that.  Having said that, though, what GWT is offers is cool enough that I might just have to play with it some.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The keynote at lunch was given by Jesse James Garrett, discussing "Beyond Ajax."  What I took away from it is the call to look beyond Ajax and really think through the problem at hand.  Ajax treats a symptom in user interfaces.  He encouraged us to look beyond band-aids (my word, not his) like Ajax and really figure out how to solve the user&#8217;s problems.  He pointed to the iPod as an example:  it has fewer features and was more expensive than the competition, but it works the way users want/need it to, so it dominates the market.  Really good keynote.</p>
</div>

<p>I spent the afternoon in a couple of less practical (for me) sessions, <a href="https://openjfx.dev.java.net">JavaFX</a> and the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui">Yahoo! User Interface</a>.  I&#8217;ve used both, though the latter more than the former, so the talks, it turns out, weren&#8217;t of much value to me.  I knew that might be the case, but I wanted to see if I might pick up something new on either technology.  I didn&#8217;t, but that&#8217;s OK.  They were both pretty good talks, and I enjoyed myself. :)</p>

<p>The expert panel after dinner was good, though depressing, spending a great deal of time on how awful web security is, and how almost hopeless the situation is with regard to fixing.  It&#8217;s not completely without hope, the experts noted, but pretty close.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I got to eat dinner with <a href="http://www.jroller.com/cschalk/">Chris Schalk</a>, formerly of Oracle and now with Google and author of my current favorite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaServer-Faces-Complete-Reference/dp/0072262400/ref=sr_1_3/002-2480877-0224803?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1189229586&amp;sr=8-3">JSF book</a> (you should all go out and buy two copies.  No, I don&#8217;t get a commission, but that&#8217;s not for lack of trying :).  We got to get caught up on what he&#8217;s been doing, and talked a bit about what he&#8217;d like to see Google do in terms of its developer community.  There should be some interesting things coming out of Google soon.  For the record, I asked about the rumored GPhone, and got the "I can neither confirm nor deny" response.  Google must train all their people on that. :P  Speaking of the GPhone&#8230;&#8203;</p>

<p>To cap the night off, during the prize raffle section, I didn&#8217;t happen to win the 24" iMac, but I got the next best thing there:  an 8GB iPhone!  The timing works out really well, as I really wanted one, and my other phone happened to have died Tuesday of this week.  To use it, I have to switch to AT&amp;T, but I&#8217;ve been wanting to ditch my current carrier anyway, so this is a great excuse.</p>

<p>As regular readers likely know, I am currently serving as the president of the <a href="http://okcjug.org">Oklahoma City Java Users Group</a>.  One of the things we&#8217;ve really been focusing on is getting the word out about our JUG, hoping to increase not only attendance, but the size of our speaker pool as well.  Since we&#8217;ve really started pushing this effort, I&#8217;ve done a fair amount of thinking about JUGs in general and have come to reinforce an idea I&#8217;ve long held:  good JUGs are more than just a once-a-month meeting.  They offer several very practical benefits to both <a href="#employees">[employees]</a> and <a href="#employers">[employers]</a>.</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>I recently made a change that I should probably note here:  In mid-May, I left my employer of the past 2+ years, <a href="http://www.iec-okc.com">IEC</a>, to join <a href="http://www.objectstream.com">Objectstream</a> as a Software Architect, and for whom I will be working at the FAA&#8217;s Mike Monroney Aernoautical Center here in Oklahoma City.  While I&#8217;m very excited about this opportunity (and have enjoyed the past few weeks), it was not an easy decision to leave IEC, as it&#8217;s a <em>really</em> great place to work.  IEC (and my boss, Mitch, in particular) gave me a degree of freedom in terms of technology that I&#8217;ve not had anywhere else.  I was able to try a lot of bleeding edge technologies and do some really neat stuff with some really sharp people.  Much of what you may have read here came from my experiences at IEC.</p>

<p>Some of you may have noticed an extended outage of this site for most of last week.  It appears that my provider was having NFS issues which, to my knowledge, are ongoing.  They told me they were watching my server hoping it would stabilize, all the while all I wanted was a functional site.  I finally got them to move me to another server, and things appear to be back to normal.  So, dear reader, I apologize for any inconvenience that might have caused either of you. :)  Believe me, no one was more irritated than I. :)</p>

        <a href="/2006/merry-christmas">Merry Christmas!</a>
        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>My general rule is that I avoid too much personal stuff here.  I have other venues for those interested in that kind of thing, but it would be remiss of me if I did not take the time to wish a merry Christmas to those that read this blog.  I truly hope your Christmas season was (and continues to be) a happy one, spent with family and friends.  More importantly than that, though, I sincerely hope each of you will take a good, honest look at the historical reason for Christmas.  Beyond the gifts and meals and parties, Christmas celebrates the birth of a Child, Jesus of Nazareth, the Savior of the world.  My hope and prayer is that you will find, if you have not already, the Light of Christ, as I did so many years ago.</p>

<p>Thanks for indulging me this personal note, and here&#8217;s hoping for a great and exciting 2007!</p>

<p>Everyone knows that one of the most important things a software project is a good name, but coming up with a good name is not easy.  To help with the process, we apply what my boss, Mitch, refers to as the front porch test, which is actually a rule of thumb from the pet world.  It goes like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When picking a name for a dog, imagine yourself standing on the front porch yelling the dog&#8217;s name out into the neighborhood.  If you think you&#8217;d feel like an idiot yelling that name, then choose something else.</p>
