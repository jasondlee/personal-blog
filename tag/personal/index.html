        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>This year was a very light year in blogging for me&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;even by my recent standards&#8201;&#8212;&#8201; for a lot of reasons that probably aren&#8217;t of much interest to others. That said, I want to close the year out as I have for years with a Christmas post. I realize that many of you may not celebrate Christmas, and for others it&#8217;s just another holiday plus lights and gifts and family. I would be remiss, though, if I didn&#8217;t close the year sharing the real, historical meaning of Christmas: the birth of a baby sent to atone for the sins of the world. There&#8217;s a lot of theology there that I won&#8217;t unpack here, but, if you&#8217;d like to hear more&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;or try to convince me that I&#8217;m wrong :)&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;I&#8217;m here for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s a beautiful setting from Evan Wickham of some of that theology. I hope it blesses you as it did me.</p>

<p>Merry Christmas!</p>

<pre>Breaking heaven’s silence we heard a human cry
Light into our darkness the Savior has arrived
Healing all the broken and teaching us to love
The Son of heaven’s glory now clothed in flesh and blood

Begotten not created from the Father before time
Virgin born Messiah both human and divine
Crucified and risen forever You will reign
We join with all the church from every age
Singing worthy is Lamb that was slain</pre>

<h1>2023</h1>



<h2>December</h2>
<ul>
    
    <li>
        <a href="/2023/christmas-2023-i-heard-the-bells">Christmas 2023 - I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day</a>
        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>As 2023 comes to a close, I want to take a slightly different approach to my Christmas greetings. I&#8217;d like to share with you a Christmas carol, and the story behind it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The poem, written by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, explores the contrasting despair in his heart against the hope of Christmas. Having lost his wife to a fire, and having his son critically wounded in the Civil War, Longfellow struggled with his faith which spoke of "peace on earth, goodwill to man" while he watched the injustice and violence in the country at war around him. At the end of the poem, written on Christmas day in 1863, he concludes with the confession that, while things seem bleak,“God is not dead, nor doth He sleep; The Wrong shall fail,The Right prevail, With peace on earth, good-will to men.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With wars and violence all over the globe, that statement is still true today. One day two thousand years ago, Jesus became a human, in the form of a tiny infant, as the final step in righting wrongs and prevailing over evil finally and fully. Christmas, then, points to Easter, and should serve as a reminder that, while evil does seem prevalent now, the day is coming when God finally says "Enough!" and declares judgment. My prayer, as it is every Christmas season (and, indeed, every day) is that this year will be the year you see Christmas as more than a chance for time off and getting and receiving gifts, but as the offering of the greatest gift of all: salvation through Jesus Christ.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Merry Christmas!</p>

would find real, lasting hope, in the birth the baby we celebrate today, Jesus Christ, Emmanuel, God with us.</p>

In the same region there were some shepherds staying out in the fields and keeping watch over
their flock by night. And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of
the Lord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened. But the angel said to them,
"Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all the people;
for today in the city of David there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
This will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."

Bought with the precious blood of Christ

From life&#8217;s first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny
No pow&#8217;r of hell, no scheme of man
