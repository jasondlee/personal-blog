        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>I recently struggled trying to text in a JavaFX ListView to wrap inside the container like
I asked it to, rather than extend (and disappear) past the boundaries of the container. After
some discussion on Twitter and a bit of Googling, I found an answer that I thought I&#8217;d share
here to, perhaps, save someone some time.</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>In my work on my <a href="/posts/2016/call-me-crazy-but-im-writing-a-book.html">book</a>, I&#8217;ve spent quite a bit of time
with JavaFX. In the chapter I just submitted, I wrote the application using the NetBeans RCP, which I think is a
great piece of software. My only "complaint", I think, is more of a philosophical one more than a technical one,
and even stating it that way is probably really over-selling it: for the most part, to use the RCP is to use
Swing. Sure, you can use JavaFX in the application, but it seems you have to hold your mouth just right to get
two-way data flow working. Possible, but it seems like a bit of work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At any rate, while casting around The Tubes to track down advice on how to solve one problem or another, I ran across
a couple of more modern application frameworks that look really promising,
<a href="http://www.drombler.org/drombler-fx/">Drombler FX</a> and <a href="http://www.dolphin-platform.io/">the Dolphin Platform</a>. Both
look pretty slick, but the former seems to be backed by "only one guy" and might be a bit slow moving, while
Dolphin is backed by Canoo and, more specifically, <a href="http://www.dolphin-platform.io/#team">Michael Heinrichs, Hendrik Ebbers, Dierk K&#246;nig</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once I finish this book and have more time to play with shiny new things, I need to give both of these a spin.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I should probably note, though, that there&#8217;s nothing really wrong with the NetBeans RCP in any real technical sense
(beyond the 'no software is perfect' notion). I just like shiny things. I did, though, successfully create my RCP
app and found the experience to be quite nice. If you need a desktop application, you should definitely check out
the RCP.</p>

Unfortunately, LiveJournal&#8217;s export tool is really limited, allowing the export of only one month at a time. There are tools to work around that, but the only ones I&#8217;ve seen require Windows, which rules me out. In typical geek fashion, then, I wrote my own tool, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jdlee/ljexport">ljexport</a>, a very quick-and-dirty JavaFX 8 application. All this does is export each month to its own file. Once you have the data, you&#8217;re on your own. :)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been tinkering with a couple of different JavaFX projects for a while now. Due to other commitments, they&#8217;ve been largely ignored recently, but I made some time this weekend to return to them. Since I last looked at them, Java 8, and, thus, JavaFX 8, have been release, so I decided to see how the tooling in NetBeans has changed to stay apace with the development of the libraries. While there are certainly updates, it seems new projects are still built using Ant. Yuck. :P I knew Adam Bien had a Maven archetype for his <a href="https://github.com/AdamBien/igniter.fx">igniter.fx</a> project, so I took a look to see what that POM does to support JavaFX. As it turns out, it&#8217;s pretty simple. For those interested, I have extracted here the basic POM:</p>

While it might simply be a case of noticing what you&#8217;re thinking about, it seems the tool has been gaining more and more momentum. From <a href="http://asciidoctor.org/">AsciiDoctor</a> to <a href="http://awestruct.org/">Awestruct</a>, to Jason Porter&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-maven-plugin">Maven plugin</a>, it seems to be everywhere. At any rate, in need of a break, I wondered if I could leverage AsciiDoctor&#8217;s Java integration library and JavaFX to make a simple editor. It&#8217;s basic and ugly, but here&#8217;s what I have.</p>

While I have no immediate plans to make this a full-featured editor, there&#8217;s a part of me that can&#8217;t help but hack on it. This evening, I added support for loading and saving files. In fact, I&#8217;m using the editor to write this post. :)</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>In a recent post showing how to use JavaFX 2 and NetBeans on the Mac, I noted that I have been unable to run NetBeans using Java 7 on my Mac for reasons I had not been able to figure out.  Now, thanks to a pointer from <a href="http://skovatch.wordpress.com/">Scott Kovatch</a>, the technical lead at Oracle for the Mac OS X port of Java, I think I can show you how to do that.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you may have guessed from my recent <a href="/2012/04/book-review-pro-javafx-2-a-definitive-guide-to-rich-clients-with-java-technology/">book review</a>, I&#8217;ve been tinkering with JavaFX some, as time as permitted.  I&#8217;ve been following the technology fairly closely since Sun announced the project way back in 2008.  When it was announced that JavaFX 2.0 was <em>finally</em> available, albeit in preview form, for the Mac, I was ecstatic.  I ran into issues, though, trying to get it to run in my <a href="http://netbeans.org">IDE</a>, though.  After some guess work and googling, I finally figured it out.  In retrospect, it may be obvious, but if you&#8217;re like me and are missing the obvious, I&#8217;m going to detail the steps I took to get it running on my Mac.  Perhaps it can help someone out.more</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first step, of course, is to download the binaries.  You can do that <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javafx/downloads/index.html">here</a>, sort of.  Since this is still a preview release at the time of this writing, you have click the teeny tiny <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javafx/downloads/devpreview-1429449.html">link</a> under the header.  Once you&#8217;ve downloaded the distribution, you need to extract it somewhere:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="rouge highlight" style="color: #24292f;background-color: #f6f8fa"><code data-lang="bash"><table class="linenotable"><tbody><tr><td class="linenos gl"><pre class="lineno">1

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can, of course, put it anywhere you want, but you&#8217;ll need to adjust the following instructions.  The next step is set up NetBeans.  NetBeans has JavaFX support out of the box, assuming your JDK has JavaFX support.  Since the Mac JDK does not yet, we need fix that.  Otherwise, you&#8217;ll see this error:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To fix this, we need to create a Java Platform with JavaFX support (I don&#8217;t know why we can&#8217;t modify the default platform, but we can&#8217;t, so we get to create a new one, which we can set to be the default if we want).  To do that, go to Tools &gt; Java Platforms, where you should see something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<a class="image" href="/images/2012/04/javaplatforms-300x185.png"><img src="/images/2012/04/javaplatforms.png" alt="javaplatforms" width="title: "'Java Platforms'""></a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To create a new Java Platform, click the (wait for it&#8230;&#8203;!) "Add Platform&#8230;&#8203;" button in the lower left corner.  OS X likes to put things in decidedly (to me) un-Unixy locations, and the JDK is no different. You can find the current JDK under <code>/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<a class="image" href="/images/2012/04/selectjdk.png"><img src="/images/2012/04/selectjdk-300x185.png" alt="selectjdk 300x185" width="title: "'Select JDK Home'""></a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We now need to give it a name, so we&#8217;ll call this "JDK 1.6 with JavaFX" and click OK.  But wait, there&#8217;s no JavaFX support! To enable JavaFX support, we have to&#8230;&#8203;um..enable it.  Doing so looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<a class="image" href="/images/2012/04/addjavafxsupport.png"><img src="/images/2012/04/addjavafxsupport-300x185.png" alt="addjavafxsupport 300x185" width="title: "'Enable JavaFX Support'""></a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can now create a new JavaFX project:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<a class="image" href="/images/2012/04/newprojectgood.png"><img src="/images/2012/04/newprojectgood.png" alt="newprojectgood" width="title: "'New Project - JavaFX bins found'""></a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your new project is ready to run.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The even more adventurous may be wondering how one would do this with Java 7, to which I say, "Good question!" : )  I have mixed luck getting NetBeans and Java 7 to play nice on my Mac.  It&#8217;s almost certainly pilot error, as I&#8217;ve done it before, as has <a href="http://www.adam-bien.com/roller/abien/entry/how_to_run_netbeans_7">Adam Bien</a>, but I haven&#8217;t had a chance to debug things (e.g., the navigation tree under projects has all the tree icons, but no text.  IIRC, the context menus are also text-less. Strange).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At any rate, as I noted earlier, in retrospect, this seems pretty easy (if a bit unintuitive) and might be documented somewhere, but I couldn&#8217;t find it.  Either way, it&#8217;s certainly documented now.  I hope it helps. : )</p>
