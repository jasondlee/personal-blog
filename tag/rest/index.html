<p>I&#8217;m currently working on a DSLs-in-Kotlin presentation for my local JUG, so I need a good domain in which to work. HTML is a great sample
domain, but it&#8217;s been done to death. After a bit of head scratching, I&#8217;ve come up with what is, I think, a somewhat novel domain: REST
application building. Sure, there are libraries like <a href="https://ktor.io/">Ktor</a>, but suffers from some very serious NIH. I&#8217;m totally
kidding, but the dearth of discussions regarding REST applications and DSL construction was good enough for me, so let&#8217;s see what we have
so far.</p>

<p>Recently, in the #glassfish channel on Freenode, a user was having trouble configuring GlassFish in a Docker environment. He was scripting the configuration
of the server, but was having trouble setting the admin user&#8217;s password, since the <code>change-admin-password</code> command takes input from <code>stdin</code>.
Fortunately, there&#8217;s REST API for that. This <code>curl</code> command will do what the user needs to do without any need for additional input:</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the password is set, this same command can be used to change the password, but <code>--user admin:$PASSWORD</code> must be added to authenticate
the request.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I should note that I don&#8217;t think this is an officially supported way to execute asadmin commands. It works, but it may change, or it may go away.
I would say that Oracle may not support doing this either, but they don&#8217;t offer <em>any</em> support, so there&#8217;s no harm there. :) Also note that
<code>AS_ADMIN_PASWORD</code> has a typo in it that may be fixed in future releases of the server. Caveat emptor! :)</p>

Tim Quinn has a nice <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/quinn/entry/a_few_changes_to_secure">overview</a> of some of the security-related changes, but one change he didn&#8217;t cover was one in the RESTful administration area, namely CSRF protection. I won&#8217;t go into the details of what <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CSRF">CSRF attack</a> is here, but I do want to show we&#8217;ve added protections to GlassFish to make sure the server is as secure as possible.</p>

<p>For the curious, we implemented the CSRF protection using a <a href="http://jersey.java.net/nonav/apidocs/latest/jersey/com/sun/jersey/api/container/filter/CsrfProtectionFilter.html">filter</a> provided by the <a href="http://jersey.java.net">Jersey</a> team.  As you can see from the javadoc, this change only affects requests that change state (POST, PUT, DELETE, etc).
To update your client code, all you need to do is add the <code>X-Requested-By</code> header.  Its value doesn&#8217;t matter:</p>

In production, of course, the server will be secured, which means our client code will have to be modified.  In this installment, we&#8217;ll see how that might be done in Java.</p>

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>In a previous post (far too long ago :), I began showing off the RESTful administration API in GlassFish v3.  In <a href="/2010/08/glassfish-administration-the-rest-of-the-story/">GlassFish Administration: The REST of the Story Part I</a>, I showed the basics of the API, what to send, what you get back, etc.  In this post, I want to show a practical use of the API, namely, deploying an application, and this time, for no particular reason other than I&#8217;m trying to learn the language, we&#8217;ll do it in Scala.</p>

<p>Of the many great things about GlassFish, one that is often mentioned most (and is, in fact, what got me involved with GlassFish as an end user years ago) is the Administration Console.  It&#8217;s an extremely powerful and capable interface, and is, if I may be so bold, orders of magnitudes better than its open source competition (it may even beat commercial competitors, but I have no experience with those).  Another powerful tool in GlassFish administration is the asadmin CLI utility, which allows for quick and easy scripting of server provisioning, etc.  Did you know, though, that GlassFish has a third administration interface?  As of GlassFish v3, we offer a RESTful administration API, based on Jersey, to allow non-Java clients to configure the app server easily.  For GlassFish 3.1, one of my main responsibilities, with the help, I should add of my coworkers Ludovic Champenois and Mitesh Meswani, has been to help improve upon the great start we had in in v3.  In this entry, we&#8217;ll take a look at the current state of the interface and learn the basics of using.</p>
