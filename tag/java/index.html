Since posting those, I&#8217;ve learned some new tricks that have changed how I integrate the various tools.

<p>A big part of the testing we do on WildFly involves in-container testing, for which we use <a href="https://arquillian.org/">Arquillian</a>. It&#8217;s a great tool when it works right, but sometimes things don&#8217;t. When that happens, I find it helpful to examine the archives that the tests produce. Fortunately, Arquillian makes that easy <strong><em>if</em></strong> you know that magic words, and they&#8217;re not easy to find, so I&#8217;m going to fix that here. :P</p>

<p>In a <a href="/posts/2021/testing-with-quarkus-jooq-testcontainers.html">recent post</a>, I showed how one could fairly easily test your Quarkus application against a Testcontainers-managed Postgres database. While that works great, my set up is a little more complex, and I found the solution lacking. In a nutshell, as part of my build, I use Flyway with H2 to create a schema, then jOOQ&#8217;s code generation against H2 to create the needed classes. That all worked well enough until I found some types that didn&#8217;t quite map correctly against newer versions of H2 (a security issue necessitated the update), so I decided I should finally make use of the same database from start to finish. In this post, I&#8217;ll show how I did it.</p>

One such server is Keycloak, an open source offering also from Red Hat. If your experience is like mine, though, securing endpoints makes testing a touch more complicated. In this post, I&#8217;d like to present and walk through a complete example of a secured Quarkus app, using Keycloak, JUnit and Wiremock.</p>

<p>If you wrote software on a DOS system in the 80s or 90s, you probably used one of the Borland
products, Turbo Pascal or Turbo C, with that beautiful, beautiful blue, mouse-enabled
text-based user interface (TUI, if you will). Those IDEs were powered by a library called
Turbo Vision (TV), which Borland documented and published for others to use. I loved it. While
we all live in a GUI world and there are lots of libraries for building GUIS, I have for
years now been dying to be able to use TV again, if for no other reason than hard core
nostalgia. The problem being that I have used C in about 2 decades, and, to be honest, I&#8217;m
not sure I&#8217;m too excited about writing even toy apps in the language. Dead end, right? Not so fast.</p>

<p>Enter, stage left: SWIG. SWIG, the Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator, is a tool for
building wrappers for libraries written in, say, C or C, for languages such as Python, PHP, and...
Java. While it may not be the best option, it's an option, and I've been tinkering with
it off and on for many, many moons now with the C version of the library open source by Borland
long ago, before they were sold off and the Borland brand quietly disappeared. Tonight, I made

still one instance per JVM, or does the <code>private</code> actually change anything? My understanding was that this was a bug, but I thought I&#8217;d
write a test just to make sure.</p>

I&#8217;d rather not monkey with changing PATH and all that, so I turned to the Linux alternatives system to handle things.  Sadly, it wasn&#8217;t quite that easy, as alternatives needs to know about your alternatives, so before I could change things, I had to educate it, which turned out be easier than I feared.  With Java 7 Update 11 installed in <code>/opt/java/jdk1.7.0_11</code> and symlinked from <code>/opt/java/latest</code>, I had to do two things.</p>

<p>I recently ran into an issue with our dependency injection system: it won&#8217;t return a list of interfaces, only implementations. That system, for what it&#8217;s worth, is <a href="http://hk2.java.net">HK2</a>, but <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/giwhl.html">CDI</a> has the same "problem". Since the rest of the system worked using these interfaces, I really wanted to solve the discoverability issue rather than redesigning that part of the system. After considering and playing with a Maven plugin, I opted to use the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/annotation/processing/package-frame.html">javax.annotation.processing</a> API. Let&#8217;s take a quick look.</p>

<p>For the GlassFish Administration Console, we have quite a few tests (about 133 at last count).  Given the nature and architecture of the application, we&#8217;ve chosen Selenium to drive our tests.  One of the problems we&#8217;ve faced, though, is understanding why a test failed due to the length of time the tests take (roughly 1.5 hours to run the whole suite).  Sometimes, we can look at the log and know exactly what failed, but not the why.  Did the screen render correctly?  Did, perhaps, the click, etc. not get performed (we&#8217;ve seen instances of that) leaving the application in a state not expected by the test?  Since I usually start the tests and move on to something else, we had no way of knowing.  Until now.  I finally sat down and figured out how to grab a screen shot when a test fails.  I&#8217;ve distilled that technique down to its essentials, which I&#8217;ll share here.</p>

The topic of application client container, or ACC, came up again recently when I was asked on Twitter about an issue with ACC and GlassFish in a clustered environment. While this user (hi, Markus! : ) <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2011/02/clustering-stateful-session-beans-with.html">figured out his issue</a> before I could be of much help, I took this opportunity finally to learn exactly what the ACC is and how to use it.

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>Of the many great things about GlassFish, one that is often mentioned most (and is, in fact, what got me involved with GlassFish as an end user years ago) is the Administration Console.  It&#8217;s an extremely powerful and capable interface, and is, if I may be so bold, orders of magnitudes better than its open source competition (it may even beat commercial competitors, but I have no experience with those).  Another powerful tool in GlassFish administration is the asadmin CLI utility, which allows for quick and easy scripting of server provisioning, etc.  Did you know, though, that GlassFish has a third administration interface?  As of GlassFish v3, we offer a RESTful administration API, based on Jersey, to allow non-Java clients to configure the app server easily.  For GlassFish 3.1, one of my main responsibilities, with the help, I should add of my coworkers Ludovic Champenois and Mitesh Meswani, has been to help improve upon the great start we had in in v3.  In this entry, we&#8217;ll take a look at the current state of the interface and learn the basics of using.</p>

In this entry, I&#8217;ll show you how to serve Facelets from a JAR file, then give some thoughts that will help, I hope, implement a database-backed approach.  I&#8217;ll be using JSF 2, so if you&#8217;re using Facelets 1.x with JSF 1.2, you&#8217;ll have to extend com.sun.facelets classes to make this work in that environment.

<p>With the recent migration of <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/scales/pages/Home">Mojarra Scales</a> to <a href="https://javaserverfaces.dev.java.net">JSF 2</a>, the old location of the Mojarra Scales demo was no longer adequate (upgrading that server posed some issues).  For that reason, I have moved the demo to a <a href="http://demo.steeplesoft.com/mojarra-scales-demo/index.jsf">new home</a>.  This server should be more up-to-date (both in terms of the application as well as the application server&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which is <a href="http://glassfish.org">GlassFish v3</a>, of course&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that runs it).  When accessing the application, please keep in mind that it&#8217;s on an old server that&#8217;s running on an AT&amp;T U-verse line, and the download times will reflect that. :)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;d also like to not that this showcases a couple of new components at the moment.  I&#8217;ve begun an implementation of the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/">YUI data table widget</a>.  At the time of this posting, basic table functions work, including client-side sorting.  More complex functionality, such as Ajax updates, are in the offing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another new component, which the demo uses extensively, is the excellent <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/SyntaxHighlighter">SyntaxHighligher</a> script from Alex Gorbatchev.  The demo uses this new component to show the page source for each demo, finally allowing you to see a given component in action, as well seeing the page markup that makes those components.  The demo is still in flux, so some things aren&#8217;t quite "perfect" yet.  For example, Safari really hates the markup the demo produces, which is a bug in the demo application itself.  Hopefully, that will soon be fixed.  For now, Safari users will need to use another <a href="http://getfirefox.org">browser</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As I&#8217;ve noted, Scales has been migrated to JSF 2.  While most components are working as expected, there are likely some minor issues to work out.

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>While JSF has had Ajax support for a long time now, it has always been through external libraries such as <a href="http://www.jboss.org/richfaces">Ajax4Jsf/RichFaces</a>, <a href="http://www.icefaces.org/main/home/">ICEfaces</a>, <a href="http://directwebremoting.org/dwr/index.html">DWR</a>, <a href="https://jsf-extensions.dev.java.net/nonav/mvn/reference-ajax.html">DynaFaces</a>, etc.  With JSF 2, the framework now has first class, standardized support for Ajax.  This is good news on several fronts.  For those that want Ajax support but would rather not import another library, that capability is now baked in, and, for those familiar with a4j or DynaFaces, it should look very familiar.  However, for those that don&#8217;t mind the external dependency, the standardized Ajax will make it much easier to mix and match component libraries on the same page, an issue that has plagued JSF for while.  In this post, I&#8217;d like to take the first approach and show how easy it is to achieve Ajaxy updates on your <code>h:dataTable</code> using only standard JSF.</p>

Since then, Rod posted a very nice <a href="http://blog.rodcoffin.com/?p=137">introduction</a> to FacesTester usage.  Today, we made our first official release, FacesTester 0.1.  The version number should indicate that it&#8217;s still a work in progress, but it is already quite functional (I, for one, have been using it to build a test suite for Mojarra Scales, which has helped drive out features and resolve bugs very quickly).

<p>As I noted in a recent <a href="/posts/changes-are-coming-to-the-glassfish-admin-console">entry</a>, we are considering moving to a desktop-like interface for the GlassFish Administration Console, where the content is in separate "windows" (decorated DIVs, basically) which can be moved, closed, minimized, etc.  As I&#8217;ve started working on a concrete implementation of some of those ideas, I quickly realized that we were going to have issues with multiple, overlapping windows.  Once you have multiple windows open, the user has to be able to bring the desired window to the front, but YUI, which will likely be the library used, doesn&#8217;t support that natively.  Fortunately, that&#8217;s easy to fix.  First, an example of the problem:</p>

<p>Over the past year or so, I&#8217;ve been slowly migrating&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;somewhat accidentally&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;to Maven.  I had even begun migrating the build environment for Scales from Ant to Maven, but hit a huge roadblock:  annotation processing.  Scales depends heavily on compile-time annotation processing, and the only thing I could find on the web was other people with the same problem.  As I was working on some of my JSFOne examples, I really wanted to use Maven, as the NetBeans support is a lot cleaner with Maven versus an externally maintained Ant build file, so I set to with renewed purpose.  Finally, I seem to have found the right query string, as I appear to have solved my problem.  The solution?  Ant.</p>

<p>Jim Driscoll wrote a really helpful <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/driscoll/archive/2008/06/writing_a_littl.html">blog entry</a> regarding the GlassFish Update Center module he wrote for Mojarra.  After reading that, I decided to revisit <a href="/glassfish-php-and-wordpress/">Quercus on GlassFish</a>.  Using Jim&#8217;s incredibly detailed entry, as well as looking at the code in the Mojarra 2.0 SVN repo, I was able to get an Update Center module working that installs and configures Quercus for you, so now all you have to do to get WordPress running, <a href="http://blogs.steeplesoft.com/glassfish-php-and-wordpress/">for example</a>, is install this module, and extract WordPress into your document.  Easy!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For those interested, the Update Center url is <a href="http://uc.steeplesoft.com/quercus.xml" class="bare">http://uc.steeplesoft.com/quercus.xml</a>.  To set this up, you&#8217;ll need to start the Update Center ($GF_HOME/updatecenter/bin/updatetool.*), switch to the Preferences tab, click Add, and fill out the form.  Once that&#8217;s done, switch to the "Available Software" tab, click the "Check for Updates" button in the upper right corner, and wait for the process to finish.  You should now see Quercus available under the "Web Technologies" section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For those interested, the source code is in my Mercurial repository <a href="http://hg.steeplesoft.com/quercus_updatecenter">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to some issues in GlassFish v2, automatic uninstallation is a bit complicated.  The module supports it, but you have to get your hands dirty to make it work.  Jim has details on his blog.</p>

<p>The JSF 2.0 Expert Group (operating under the auspices of <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=314">JSR 314</a>) has released Early Draft Review 1 of the upcoming revision of the spec.  We are soliciting feedback, of course, and the window of opportunity for that runs through July 2.  If you want to have some input on the direction of the specification, now is the time to speak up. :)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The major changes in this draft release are baked in Ajax support, and what we&#8217;ve termed "EZComp," which is better described as composite components.  Composite components, which touches on a change to finalized in a later release, namely, the inclusion of Facelets, allows a component developer to create a new component by piecing together several others in a template file.  This functionality is very similar, as best as I can tell as I&#8217;ve never used them, to Facelets' component support, where a snippet of markup is specified in a file and can then be treated as an actual component.  Unlike the Facelets version, though, these composite components are "real" components in that they are backed by a UIComponent.  If you were at JavaOne, this is what Ed demoed in this presentation (with Roger demonstrating the Ajax support).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s still much work to be done before September when we are schedule to deliver the Proposed Final Draft, but this is a pretty good start.  If you have any interest at all, please review the spec and give us feedback.  We really do want your input, as our goal is to improve upon the JSF experience and solve as many of the real world pain points as we can.  If your favorite pain point isn&#8217;t being addressed, you owe it to yourself to speak up! :)</p>

<p>My day started today with the Intel general session.  I went in with low expectations for some reason, but came away pretty pleased.  The speaker, Douglas Fisher, Vice President, Software and Solutions Group and General Manager, Systems Software Division of Intel Corporation, talked about how software drives innovation in hardware, which makes possible more interesting things in hardware, which in turn drives more innovation in hardware, and the cycle repeats.  Years ago, an Intel exec whose name escapes me  described this as the software spiral.  He then brought a Sun exec (Jeet Kaul, if I recall correctly) onto the stage to discuss performance gains in the JVM, presumably in the virtualization space.  He shared how from January 2007 to JavaOne 2007, they made a 20% gain in performance, so they set their goal for JavaOne 2008 at 60%.  They announced today a 68% gain, with the demo peaking at 74%, on the exact same hardware and software that was used last year.  The only difference was the JVM.  Very cool.</p>

<p>Next week, I&#8217;ll be off to JavaOne.

Sadly, it wasn&#8217;t as easy as I thought it would be (though I certainly could be the failure in the process :).  After I imported my schedule into Outlook (used only&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and grudgingly&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;as iTunes is broken in that it only supports Outlook) and then synced that with my Google Calendar, all of the event start times were adjusted for the time zone differences.  Importing by CSV resulted in cryptic messages about my calendar not being available, so I did what any good geek would do:  I wrote my own solution, creatively named J1Sync.</p>

Since Scales is now using JSFTemplating to make the component authoring process easier, I have been able to use this facility, allowing me to deprecate some custom code.  In the process of making the migration, I&#8217;ve made changes to JSFTemplating that will be of benefit to all.

The part that caught me by surprise and confuses me greatly is why the inclusion of JavaServer Faces in the web profile would be controversial.  Having spoken with an expert group member, who I will not out :), the argument comes down to this:  "We shouldn&#8217;t force a broken technology, that is not the clear winner on people."  I think that&#8217;s a very interesting statement, in that it precludes doing just about anything in the spec.</p>

One of the coolest features, I think, is its introduction of templating events (e.g., one can attach a beforeEncode event to a component on a page and have a handler method fire before that component is encoded).  The first comment I hear, though, is usually something about template syntax, and it does seem a bit foreign with things like <code>&lt;!if $attribute{in} &amp; ! (#{in} = abc) &gt;</code> and &lt;span class="code"&gt;&#35;include /header.inc&lt;/span&gt;.  That&#8217;s where I come in.</p>

<p>As we&#8217;ve done more and more EJB development, we&#8217;ve had to think pretty hard about how to unit test our beans.

I&#8217;m pretty happy with the method we&#8217;re using now, and it&#8217;s so simple, I&#8217;m a bit embarrassed that we didn&#8217;t think of it earlier.</p>

I've been doing a fair amount of JSF component writing of late, and, invariably, I miss one or more "minor" details, causing my component to explode in spectacular fashion at runtime.  What follows, then, is a check list for writing JSF components, with notes on the differences between the 1.1 and 1.2 versions of the specification.

        <div><div class="paragraph">
<p>At work, we have run into two issues several times:  1) We haves app that create PDFs, and we need our JSF apps to send that to the user, and 2) we need to be able to upload multiple files to one of our JSF apps.  The solutions we&#8217;ve used have been less than exciting.  For the first problem, we&#8217;d make the backing bean that coordinates the PDF creation (calling the service layer, basically) session-scoped, then have a hidden iframe on the result page whose source is a JSP that pulls the bean out the session (via Java code!) and sends the PDF to the browser in such a way that forces the user to save the file.  For the upload issue, we&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://jupload.sourceforge.net">JUpload</a>, which works fine, but, since it lives outside the JSF lifecycle, we have to do some interesting things to make it work.  Luckily, my boss gave me time to create better solutions, resulting in the components <code>&lt;fl:download/&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;fl:multiFileUpload/&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re doing web development, you have likely at least heard of Ajax, and, if you&#8217;re not currently using it, you&#8217;ve likely investigated its possible use.  One of the tricky aspects of working with a technology like Ajax is integrating it with various frameworks.  JavaServer Faces, now a standard part of the Java EE stack, is no different.  For both a page and component author, the integration issue can be a big question.  Luckily for those of us in the JSF world, that question has been addressed by Chris Schalk and Ed Burns, in their new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaServer-Faces-Complete-Reference/dp/0072262400/ref=sr_11_1/104-8011241-4536743?ie=UTF8">JavaServer Faces:  The Complete Reference</a>.</p>

<p>Several months ago at <a href="http://www.iec-okc.com">work</a>, we evaluated a handful of methods for dependency downloads.

In the end, we decided to stay with our home grown solution, as we were led to believe that the next version of ant would have transitive dependency management built in.  We concluded that it would be a waste of time to migrate to one solution, just to do it again when the new ant came out, so we waited, and, oh, how disappointed we were.</p>

As I&#8217;ve prepared for that talk, I&#8217;ve thought quite a bit about the web apps I write, which are, for the most part, pretty boring.  I like to think that they&#8217;re functional, but I have to admit that they&#8217;re pretty plain. Ajax, though, along with the Javascript pretties that usually accompany an Ajaxified application, is a good way of fixing that "problem", assuming it&#8217;s done properly.  That line of thinking has affected how I&#8217;ve approached a new app I started at work, but finding a library that works well with JSF (read as, in a JSF-friendly manner) has been a bit of a challenge.</p>

<p>In my ongoing efforts to learn the JSF framework as thoroughly as possible, I decided to write a component, but, with the myriad of high quality components available, what was left for me to do? :P At the suggestion of my brother, who has been watching a similar effort underway in the <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net/">Wicket</a> space, I&#8217;ve decided to wrap Yahoo&#8217;s <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui">UI library</a>.  The problem I ran into pretty quickly, though, was that the documentation wasn&#8217;t too clear as to what I needed to make it happen (though it&#8217;s quite likely I was having an obtuse moment or three).  There are a plethora of resources that discuss what needs to be done, but all seemed either incomplete or too disjointed (see disclaimer above).  So, to help ameliorate that, let&#8217;s walk through wrapping Yahoo&#8217;s calendar component as a JSF component, step by step.  Before I go much further, though, I must note that I am by no means an expert in this, so it&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;re going to see some less than ideal examples.
