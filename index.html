<p>Last night, I had the opportunity to present at my local jug, the <a href="https://okcjug.org">Oklahoma City Java User Group</a>. My topic was building applications Kotlin/Compose Multiplatform. For the most part, it was awesome. More on that in a moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://jasondl.ee/presentations/compose-multiplatform/">presentation</a> was an introduction to the technologies that I&#8217;ve found helpful in building cross-platform applications. I tried to be clear that what I was presenting is my <em>current</em> architecture and that things might change, and that I was <em>learning</em> some of these things as I go. I find it helpful to present on things that I&#8217;m learning, as it helps solidify things in my own mind, and it might be useful for others to travel along with me, so to speak. I won&#8217;t recap here everything in the presentation, so if you&#8217;d like details, you can flip through the <a href="https://jasondl.ee/presentations/compose-multiplatform/">slides</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The demo app is one I&#8217;ve called (because I&#8217;m a sucker for puns), "Giftbook"&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;like "Facebook", but for gifts. The inspiration for the app (which is in part intended to serve as an architectural reference app for my younger son as he builds a mobile app for a high school class, as well as for a project my wife and I are working on together) came from my wife. She typically handles the bulk of our gift shopping, and she uses an app to help keep track of that. The app is great and helpful, but it has shortcomings, and in the course of discussing those, we did what any good geek would do: we decided to build our own. It&#8217;s still a work in progress, but you can follow along (and contribute if you want) over at <a href="https://github.com/jasondlee/giftbook">Github</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I said the meeting was awesome "for the most part" earlier. I had hoped to have a video of the presentation to post the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OklahomaCityJUG">OKC JUG YouTube channel</a>, but&#8230;&#8203; there were problems. Since I was presenting, I couldn&#8217;t run the recording device, so I conscripted my beautiful and brilliant wife to do handle that, and she did great, but the forces against us were greater. :) A big part of the problem is OBS. I spent part of the morning yesterday making sure everything was set up and working, but when we got to the venue, OBS had forgotten input devices, microphone levels were messed up, etc., so we had to hastily try to reconfigure things moments before the session started. Neither of us know OBS well, and we mostly got it working, but the audio in the video we ended up actually getting was great, then silent, then really low. Not sure what was going on there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The coup de grâce for the recording, though, happened when the laptop died. :P What we didn&#8217;t notice was that the power strip was not turned on, so the laptop was running on battery until it wasn&#8217;t. We did manage to record about two-thirds of the presentation before things completely fell over, but the audio is next to useless, making the video a bit of a waste.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I learned (or had reinforced) a few things, though: I need to learn OBS better (or find a simpler replacement), and I need to conscript more dedicated help. I had a million plates spinning last night, and I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to pull of the meeting if it hadn&#8217;t been for my amazing wife (I&#8217;ve said this directly to her, but I&#8217;ll say it again here: A HUGE thanks for the help. You&#8217;re awesome. :)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given all of that, there&#8217;s a chance I&#8217;ll make a recording of the presentation from my office so I can have something to upload. I need to tweak the presentation a bit (including replacing that super dumb and boring title, something my wife and older son have been helping me brainstorm), so if I can find some time, I&#8217;ll make those changes and try to put a recording.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite the technical woes, I had a great time seeing old friends at the JUG, and even got to meet a few new people, which is always great. Having part of my family there was big bonus, as well.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working on a side project that includes both a backend (<a href="https://quarkus.io">Quarkus</a>-based, of course) and a mobile app (I&#8217;m using
<a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html">Kotlin Multiplatform</a>, but that&#8217;s a topic for another time). In this project, I need to display an image (think profile
picture), but the link is secured, meaning I need to authenticate with the server to get it. I couldn&#8217;t find anything in
the <a href="https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/">Coil</a> docs explaining directly how to do that, but I was finally able to piece it together, and I&#8217;d like to share
that here in case it helps someone else.</p>

<p>This year was a very light year in blogging for me&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;even by my recent standards&#8201;&#8212;&#8201; for a lot of reasons that probably aren&#8217;t of much interest to others. That said, I want to close the year out as I have for years with a Christmas post. I realize that many of you may not celebrate Christmas, and for others it&#8217;s just another holiday plus lights and gifts and family. I would be remiss, though, if I didn&#8217;t close the year sharing the real, historical meaning of Christmas: the birth of a baby sent to atone for the sins of the world. There&#8217;s a lot of theology there that I won&#8217;t unpack here, but, if you&#8217;d like to hear more&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;or try to convince me that I&#8217;m wrong :)&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;I&#8217;m here for you.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a beautiful setting from Evan Wickham of some of that theology. I hope it blesses you as it did me.</p>

<pre>Breaking heaven’s silence we heard a human cry
Light into our darkness the Savior has arrived
Healing all the broken and teaching us to love
The Son of heaven’s glory now clothed in flesh and blood

Begotten not created from the Father before time
Virgin born Messiah both human and divine
Crucified and risen forever You will reign
We join with all the church from every age
Singing worthy is Lamb that was slain</pre>

<p>As 2023 comes to a close, I want to take a slightly different approach to my Christmas greetings. I&#8217;d like to share with you a Christmas carol, and the story behind it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The poem, written by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, explores the contrasting despair in his heart against the hope of Christmas. Having lost his wife to a fire, and having his son critically wounded in the Civil War, Longfellow struggled with his faith which spoke of "peace on earth, goodwill to man" while he watched the injustice and violence in the country at war around him. At the end of the poem, written on Christmas day in 1863, he concludes with the confession that, while things seem bleak,“God is not dead, nor doth He sleep; The Wrong shall fail,The Right prevail, With peace on earth, good-will to men.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With wars and violence all over the globe, that statement is still true today. One day two thousand years ago, Jesus became a human, in the form of a tiny infant, as the final step in righting wrongs and prevailing over evil finally and fully. Christmas, then, points to Easter, and should serve as a reminder that, while evil does seem prevalent now, the day is coming when God finally says "Enough!" and declares judgment. My prayer, as it is every Christmas season (and, indeed, every day) is that this year will be the year you see Christmas as more than a chance for time off and getting and receiving gifts, but as the offering of the greatest gift of all: salvation through Jesus Christ.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Merry Christmas!</p>

<p>A friend of mine is a very good Angular developer. For a project he&#8217;s been asked to help with, though, he finds himself needing to do some backend work. Since that&#8217;s a bit outside his wheelhouse, he asked me for advice. In this post, I&#8217;ll write up what I told him in case it might be of use to someone else.</p>

<p>One of the toughest challenges facing a mature product like WildFly is adding features without breaking existing users. It&#8217;s especially difficult when that project serves as the foundation for a commercial product downstream that requires a higher degree of stability. While WildFly is a wholly independent project, it&#8217;s not completely immune to concerns that EAP may have with regard to API stability, long term support, etc. That has made it difficult at times to change WildFly, though efforts like WildFly Preview have certainly helped.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With that in mind, I&#8217;d like to draw your attention to a project WildFly/EAP engineer extraordinaire, Paul Ferraro <a href="https://lists.jboss.org/archives/list/wildfly-dev@lists.jboss.org/thread/4JCTIWREUBBX4DVIJIUAFQ2FWDBN3AXW/">recently announced</a> on the <a href="https://lists.jboss.org/archives/list/wildfly-dev@lists.jboss.org/">wildfly-dev email list</a>.

<p>For several years now, WildFly has supported the ability to install and use different Jakarta Faces (Faces) implementations, either across every application deployed to the server, or for a specific application only. We supported running either Mojarra and MyFaces, with versions running all the way back to 1.2. With the move to Jakarta EE 10, however, that feature was temporarily broken simply because there was not a 4.0-compliant version of MyFaces available by the time we were ready to ship. That has changed now, though, as has the manner in which we support changing the implementations. In this short post, I&#8217;ll show you how that works starting in WildFly 29.</p>
