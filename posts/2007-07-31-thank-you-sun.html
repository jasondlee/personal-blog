<p>I'm a bit hesitant to post this as I'm afraid that it may come across as self-congratulatory, which is not my intent at all, but I think Sun deserves an "atta-boy."<!--more-->
</p>
<p>Recently, Sun sought to reward various contributors who they felt have been a boon to GlassFish.  On two different occasions, I have been blessed to be recipient of Sun's largess.  At JavaOne 2007, which I was unable to attend, I was selected as one of the (first?) <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.sun.com/theaquarium/entry/not_your_usual_ipod_contest">GlassFish Champions</a>, and awarded an <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.sun.com/theaquarium/resource/GlassFishChampionIpod-Large.jpg">engraved iPod Nano</a> (which I'm enjoying now :).  Most recently, I was selected as the <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.sun.com/theaquarium/entry/glassfish_v2_tv_contest_winner">winner</a> of GlassFish's <a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/community/campaigns/gftv-052007/welcome.jsp">Fish for a TV</a> competition.  I'm extremely flattered by both honors, and I can't thank Sun enough for wanting to reward its community members (and me in particular).  I think it speaks volumes about Sun's seriousness about Open Source.
</p>
<p>At any rate, I don't want to dwell too much on me on this blog, but I felt that Sun deserved the press.  By the way, here's a picture of the TV, which we are enjoying immensely. :)
