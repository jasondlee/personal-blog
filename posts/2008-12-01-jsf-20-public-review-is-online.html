<p>The current state of the JSF 2 spec has entered the Public Review phase.  If you have any interest in JSF, now is a good time to review what we've done in the spec thus far and send feedback, which we will discuss and digest for the Proposed Final Draft due out next.  You can find the Public Review <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/pr/jsr314/index.html">here</a>, and you can send your comments <a href="mailto:jsr-314-comments@jcp.org">here</a>.
