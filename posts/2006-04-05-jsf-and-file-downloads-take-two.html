<p>Yesterday, I <a target="_newwindow" href="http://blogs.steeplesoft.com/2006/04/04/jsf-and-file-downloads/">detailed</a> some issues I was having getting a JSF app to allow the download of an Excel spreadsheet as the result of a backing bean action being called.  My solution involved a servlet and some JavaScript, with just a <strike>pinch</strike> a fistful of kludge.

<p>Thanks to the esteemed Mr. Chad Cummings, I have a better solution, and it involves one small change to the backing bean (the navigation target returned) and the addition of this snippet to the JSF page:
</p>
<p>[source lang="xml"]<h___panelGrid columns="1" rendered="#{batchAuditReportBean.workBook != null}">
</p>
    <f___verbatim>
        <iframe src="success.jsp" style="visibility: hidden"/>
    </f___verbatim>
</h:panelGrid>[/source]
<p>Is it still a bit of a hack?  Maybe so, but it does work, and is a whole lot cleaner.  That's a plus in my book, so I'm going to commit this to our <a target="_newwindow" href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> repository.</p>
