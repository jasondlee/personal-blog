<p>The GlassFish webinar series is, I think,  a pretty valuable resource for regular readers of my blog, as it covers a lot of topics that I cover here.  Today's <a target="_blank" href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/TheAquarium/ICEFaces+and+JSF2.0">webinar</a>, "From Ajax Push to JSF 2.0: ICEfaces on GlassFish," is particularly relevant, as it's a JSF-related session.  Here's the abstract:
</p>
<blockquote>Ted will provide details on how to build and deploy rich web applications with Ajax and Ajax Push (aka Comet) and catch a glimpse of the future with an overview of JavaServer Faces 2.0.
<p>This presentation illustrates the fundamentals of Ajax Push, covering application design, development, and deployment, drawing on ICEfaces sample applications and implementation. Topics will include network protocols, application-level push APIs, GlassFish Grizzly integration, and the ramifications of the two-connection limit.
</p>
<p>Looking forward to JSF 2.0, we will cover Ajax integration, new scopes and annotations, and custom components. </blockquote>
</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to see Ted present Ajax Push (their term for Reverse Ajax or Comet, if you prefer those monikers) at last year's <a target="_blank" href="http://jsfone.com">JSFOne</a> conference.  The ICEfaces demos are very, very slick, and the level of simplicity they managed to achieve is absolutely amazing.  If you have any interest in Ajax Push/Reverse Ajax/Comet, you should certainly attend this session.  If you are currently using JSF, this is a really good example of the power of component-based frameworks like JSF.</p>
