<p>Today, <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.sun.com/rlubke/">Ryan Lubke</a> committed code to the Mojarra tree that will allow a JSF developer to prototype and/or develop just about every JSF artifact using <a target="_blank" href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a>.  When deployed to the server in development mode, the Groovy file can be changed on disk, and the changes will be picked up automatically, allowing one to avoid the compile/package/deploy cycle that can make Java web development so tedious.  Once the artifact is "done," the Groovy source can be copied to a Java source file and compiled (or the build process can compile the .groovy files to .class files) for production deployment.  This could be a really nice feature for component development, for example.

<p>All around, a very, very cool enhancement.  Great work, Ryan!
