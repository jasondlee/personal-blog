<p>Way back in July, Ed Burns <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/2010/07/20/mojarra-1215-released">released and announced</a> Mojarra 1.2_15, which is mostly a backport of performance fixes from the 2.0 branch.  Given <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/rlubke/entry/grizzly_2_0_now_has">recent changes</a> on the Mojarra team<sup>1</sup>, there was some confusion and difficulty getting the jars published to the <a href="http://download.java.net/maven/1">java.net Maven repository</a>.  I'm happy to report, though, that we've gotten those kinks worked out, and that this new release of the 1.2 branch of Mojarra is <a href="http://download.java.net/maven/1/javax.faces/jars/">now available</a> for your Mavenized pleasure.  Note that this is the Maven 1 repository, and it's not in central.  Those are separate issues on which we're still working.
