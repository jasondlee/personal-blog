The program was very successful for Prelude, resulting in many, many reported (and fixed! : ) issues for the Prelude release.  As we press hard toward the release of GlassFish v3 final later this fall, this program has been re-launched to help us engage our user community.  Through this program, testers will have a much greater impact on the final quality of the product when it finally ships.  If you'd like more information, you can see the announcement <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/judy/entry/announcing_v3_fishcat_a_community">here</a>, and a description of the program <a href="http://wiki.glassfish.java.net/Wiki.jsp?page=FishCAT">here</a>.
