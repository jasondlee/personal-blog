<p>While many have found GlassFish to be a great choice for an internal application server, there are others that would like to push it a bit further, and use it in an ASP/ISP envrionment.  Jan Luehe discussed GlassFish's virtual hosting features in a recent <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.sun.com/jluehe/entry/virtual_hosting_features_in_glassfish">blog entry</a>.  What I'd like to do in this entry is take the information that Jan presented, and walk through setting up a few different virtual hosting environments.<!--more-->

<h3>Terms to Know</h3>
<p>Before we go too far, we need to make sure we're all using various terms in the same manner.  To summarize Shreedhar Ganapathy's excellent <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.sun.com/shreedhar/entry/understanding_the_glassfish_domain_model">discussion</a>, a <em>domain</em> in GlassFish terms is an "administrative area."  It should not be confused with DNS domains.  A domain will have one or more <em>servers</em> defined.  These servers correlate, roughly, with a <code>ServerName</code> in Apache's httpd.conf (and, like a <code>ServerName</code> can have <code>ServerAlias</code>es, a server can be given aliases).  For the sake of this discussion, we will not give any attention to clustering or load balancing.
</p>
<p>Before a vhost environment can be set up, one must ask:  Do the vhosts need to be completely separated from each other?  That is to say, will the production environment need to be configured in such a way that an administrator for one group of servers can not touch another group of servers?  If you intended to have one administrator admin all servers, you can probably get by with one domain.  However, if you need to allow a user to administer his servers without having access to another user's servers, then you will need to create additional domains.  We'll start with the simple case, and look at multiple servers in one domain.
</p>
<h3>One Domain, Multiple Servers</h3>
<p>We'll start by configuring GlassFish.  We'll use two vhosts, vh1 and vh2.  To add a virtual server from the admin console, go to Configuration->HTTP Service->Virtual Servers:
</p>

<p>Click add, and fill out the form:
</p>
<a href='http://blogs.steeplesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/virtual_servers_02.png' title='Adding a virtual server'><img src='http://blogs.steeplesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/virtual_servers_02.thumbnail.png' alt='Adding a virtual server' /></a>
<p>I've chosen to use <em>http-listener-1</em> only, as I only care about http://vh1:8080/ being available.  Repeat the process for server <em>vh2</em>.  For those that prefer the command line, the server can be created with this command:
</p>
<p>[source lang="xml"]
</p>
<p>asadmin create-virtual-server --user admin --hosts vh1 --httplisteners http-listener-1 vh1
</p>
<p>asadmin create-virtual-server --user admin --hosts vh2 --httplisteners http-listener-1 vh2
</p>
<p>[/source]
</p>
<p>While there are a myriad of options regarding port usage, I like to have Apache handle requests on port 80, and forward requests for my vhosts to the appropriate server behind it, so let's take a look at that configuration:
</p>
<p>[source lang="xml"]
</p>
<VirtualHost *:80>
<p>    ServerName vh1
</p>
<p>    ProxyPass / http://vh1:8080/
</p>
<p>    ProxyPassReverse / http://vh1:8080/
</p>
</VirtualHost>
<VirtualHost *:80>
<p>    ServerName vh2
</p>
<p>    ProxyPass / http://vh2:8080/
</p>
<p>    ProxyPassReverse / http://vh2:8080/
</p>
</VirtualHost>
<p>[/source]
</p>
<p>With that, your virtual hosts should be ready.  To test that things are working correctly, let's deploy two applications (which, I'm afraid, you'll have to supply :) ).
</p>
<a href='http://blogs.steeplesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/app_deployment_01.png' title='Deploying an app to a virtual server'><img src='http://blogs.steeplesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/app_deployment_01.thumbnail.png' alt='Deploying an app to a virtual server' /></a>
<p>Command line users can do:
</p>
<p>[source lang="xml"]
</p>
<p>asadmin deploy --virtualservers vh1 AppA.ear
</p>
<p>asadmin deploy --virtualservers vh2 AppB.ear
</p>
<p>[/source]
</p>
<p>With these apps deployed, <code>http://vh1/AppA</code> should get your app, while <code>http://vh2/AppA</code> should get a 404, and vice versa.  If you deploy a third app and do not specify a virtual server:
</p>
<p>[source lang="xml"]
</p>
<p>asadmin deploy AppC.ear
</p>
<p>[/source]
</p>
<br/>
<p>then <code>http://vh1/AppC</code> and <code>http://vh2/AppC</code> will both work.  Here are some rules to keep in mind:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>If, when deploying an application, a virtual server is not specified, then the app is available to all servers in that domain.</li>
	<li>If an application is deployed to one or more specific virtual servers, then it will not be available to any virtual servers not in that list.</li>
	<li>Likewise, if an application is deployed to one or more specific virtual servers, then it will not be available to be used as the <strong>Default Web Module</strong> for any virtual servers not in that list.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Multiple Domains, Multiple Servers</h3>
<p>If you need to segregate administrative control amongst users, such as in an ASP/ISP environment, then you will need multiple domains.  When you setup the server, the default domain, <em>domain1</em>, is created for you.  Since a domain is an administrative area, one can not use the admin console to create another domain, and must use the <code>asadmin</code> command line tool.  A session might look something like this:
</p>
<p>[source lang="xml"]
</p>
<p>asadmin create-domain --portbase 5000 --profile developer mydomain
</p>
<p>Please enter the admin user name>admin
</p>
<p>Please enter the admin password>
</p>
<p>Please enter the admin password again>
</p>
<p>Please enter the master password [Enter to accept the default]:>
</p>
<p>Please enter the master password again [Enter to accept the default]:>
</p>
<p>Using port 5048 for Admin.
</p>
<p>Using port 5080 for HTTP Instance.
</p>
<p>Using port 5076 for JMS.
</p>
<p>Using port 5037 for IIOP.
</p>
<p>Using port 5081 for HTTP_SSL.
</p>
<p>Using port 5038 for IIOP_SSL.
</p>
<p>Using port 5039 for IIOP_MUTUALAUTH.
</p>
<p>Using port 5086 for JMX_ADMIN.
</p>
<p>Domain being created with profile:developer, as specified on command line or environment.
</p>
<p>Security Store used should be: JKS
</p>
<p>Domain mydomain created.
</p>
<p>[/source]
</p>
<p>The documentation has this to say about domains:
</p>
<div class="quote">A domain, in addition to being an  administrative  boundary, is also a  fully compliant Java EE Server. This means that you can can deploy your Java EE  Applications to the domain and run them when the domain is  started.  A  domain  provides  all   the necessary environment and services that are essential to run the applications.</div>
<p>That being so, each domain will have its own set of ports.  Note the use of the <code>portbase</code> option above.  That instructs <code>asadmin</code> to start allocating ports starting at 5000 according to this pattern:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Admin port: <code>portbase</code> + 48, HTTP</li>
	<li>Listener port: <code>portbase </code> +  80</li>
	<li>IIOP  listener  port: <code>portbase</code> + 37</li>
	<li>JMX port: <code>portbase</code> + 86</li>
</ul>
<p>We specified the developer profile, as we do not need clustering, high availability, etc., for our purposes here, but please note that option if you do indeed need those capabilities.
</p>
<p>With our domain created and start (<code>asadmin start-domain mydomain</code>), we can now begin creating virtual servers and deploying applications in the same manner we did above.  Note that, for those using Apache as the front end, the virtual host configuration will need to be adjusted accordingly:
</p>
<p>[source lang="xml"]
</p>
<VirtualHost *:80>
<p>    ServerName vh3
</p>
<p>    ProxyPass / http://vh3:5080/
</p>
<p>    ProxyPassReverse / http://vh3:5080/
</p>
</VirtualHost>
<VirtualHost *:80>
<p>    ServerName vh4
</p>
<p>    ProxyPass / http://vh4:5080/
</p>
<p>    ProxyPassReverse / http://vh4:5080/
</p>
</VirtualHost>
<p>[/source]
</p>
<p>and that your admin console is listening at http://localhost:5048/.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>That should get you going!  There are some details that have been glossed over (such as memory usage), but you should now have in your hands a step-by-step guide on creating, configuring, and maintaining virtual servers using GlassFish.  If you have any questions, comments, corrections, etc., please feel free to leave a comment.</p>
