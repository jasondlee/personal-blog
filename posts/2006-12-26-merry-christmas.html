<p>My general rule is that I avoid too much personal stuff here.  I have other venues for those interested in that kind of thing, but it would be remiss of me if I did not take the time to wish a merry Christmas to those that read this blog.  I truly hope your Christmas season was (and continues to be) a happy one, spent with family and friends.  More importantly than that, though, I sincerely hope each of you will take a good, honest look at the historical reason for Christmas.  Beyond the gifts and meals and parties, Christmas celebrates the birth of a Child, Jesus of Nazareth, the Savior of the world.  My hope and prayer is that you will find, if you have not already, the Light of Christ, as I did so many years ago.

<p>Thanks for indulging me this personal note, and here's hoping for a great and exciting 2007!</p>
