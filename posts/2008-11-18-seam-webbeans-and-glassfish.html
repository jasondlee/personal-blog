<p>For some time now, Sun has made use of Ustream.TV to broadcast webinars covering various topics of interest to GlassFish users.&nbsp; That effort continues on November 20th at 11am PST as Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart hosts <a href="http://mojavelinux.com/">Dan Allen</a>, author of <a href="http://www.manning.com/dallen/">Seam in Action</a> to discuss Seam, WebBeans, and GlassFish.&nbsp; Some of WebBeans' companion specs (EJB 3.1 and JSF 2) will also be covered by spec leads Ken Saks and Roger Kitain, respectively.&nbsp; For more information, see this <a href="https://wikis.sun.com/display/TheAquarium/Seam+and+WebBeans">page</a> on Sun's wiki.&nbsp; To catch previous broadcasts on The Aquarium's Ustream.TV channel, you can go directly <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/theaquarium">there</a>.<br />
