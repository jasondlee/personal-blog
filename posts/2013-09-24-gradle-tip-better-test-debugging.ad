In a link:/posts/2013/09/10/gradle-tip-attaching-a-debugger/[recent post], I showed how to attach a debugger to tests run from the command line via Gradle. While it worked, it turns out that it's a bit over kill.  Try this instead:

[source,bash]
-----
$ gradle -Dtest.debug test
:compileJava
:processResources UP-TO-DATE
:classes
:compileTestJava
:processTestResources
:testClasses
:test
Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 5005

Attach your debugger to port 5005, and off you go. No need to modify your build.  Kudos to the http://netbeans.org[NetBeans] debugger output for helping me find that. ;)
