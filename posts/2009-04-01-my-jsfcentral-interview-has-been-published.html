<p>Careful readers of my blog (thank you, dear wife! : ) will remember that I was <a target="_blank" href="/jsfone-day-one/">interviewed</a> at <a target="_blank" href="http://jsfone.com">JSFOne</a> by the conference co-founder and <a target="_blank" href="http://jsfcentral.com">JSFCentral</a> founder Kito Mann.  That interview, complete with transcript, has been <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jsfcentral.com/articles/lee-03-09.html">published</a> on JSFCentral.  I was a bit nervous about how it would turn out, but I think it turned out pretty well.  I'm not a big fan of hearing my recorded voice, but there's not much to be done about that. :)</p>
