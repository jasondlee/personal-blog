Some of you may have noticed an extended outage of this site for most of last week.  It appears that my provider was having NFS issues which, to my knowledge, are ongoing.  They told me they were watching my server hoping it would stabilize, all the while all I wanted was a functional site.  I finally got them to move me to another server, and things appear to be back to normal.  So, dear reader, I apologize for any inconvenience that might have caused either of you. :)  Believe me, no one was more irritated than I. :)
