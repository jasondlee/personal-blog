<!--pull-->Then, bursting forth in glorious day
<p>Up from the grave He rose again<!--/pull-->There in the ground His body lay
</p>
<p>Light of the world by darkness slain
</p>
<p>Then, bursting forth in glorious day
</p>
<p>Up from the grave He rose again
</p>
<p>And as He stands in victory
</p>
<p>Sin's curse has lost it's grip on me
</p>
<p>For I am His and He us mine
</p>
<p>Bought with the precious blood of Christ
</p>
<p>No guilt in life, no fear in death
</p>
<p>This is power of Christ in me
</p>
<p>From life's first cry to final breath
</p>
<p>Jesus commands my destiny
</p>
<p>No pow'r of hell, no scheme of man
</p>
<p>Can ever pluck me from His hand
</p>
<p>'Til He returns or calls me home
</p>
<p>Here in the pow'r of Christ I'll stand</p>
