<p>In <a href="/2009/12/new-components-in-mojarra-scales-part-ii-–-scautocomplete/">Part II</a> of this series, I introduced the new auto complete component in Mojarra Scales.  In this installment, we'll take a look at two new closely related components, <code>sc___imageZoomer</code> and <code>sc___lightbox</code>.<!--more-->
</p>
<p>The first component, <code>sc___imageZoomer</code>, displays a thumbnail, and, when clicked, "zooms" that thumbnail up to the full size image.  Here is a sample usage:
</p>
<p>[source lang="xhtml"]
</p>
        <sc___imageZoomer thumb="#{request.contextPath}/images/thumbs/image1.jpg" 
<p>            image="#{request.contextPath}/images/image1.jpg"
</p>
<p>            caption="Some descriptive caption"/>
</p>
<p>[/source]
</p>
<p>Given the active nature of the component, a screen shot wouldn't be that interesting, so to see it in action, point your browser at the Image Zoomer <a href="http://demo.steeplesoft.com/mojarra-scales-demo/imageZoomer.jsf">demo</a>.
</p>
<p>The next component is <code>sc___lightbox</code>.  Chances are good that you've seen a <a href="http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/">lightbox</a> before.  When an image is clicked, it "zooms" up, and navigation is offered to go to the previous or next image in the group.  While using the lightbox library linked above has never been tedious to use, Mojarra Scales makes it even easier now:
</p>
<p>[source lang="xhtml"]
</p>
        <sc___lightbox id="lightbox2">
            <h___outputLink id="boxer1" value="images/boxers/Boxer1.jpg" >
                <h___graphicImage value="images/boxers/tBoxer1.jpg" 
<p>                    alt="Good looking dog (demo 2)"/>
</p>
            </h:outputLink>
            <h___outputLink id="boxer2" value="images/boxers/BoxerFace.jpg">
                <h___graphicImage value="images/boxers/tBoxerFace.jpg" 
<p>                    alt="Only a mother could love that face. (demo 2)"/>
</p>
            </h:outputLink>
        </sc___lightbox>
<p>[/source]
</p>
<p>The sample above puts two images on the page, adding them to the "lightbox2" group.  To use the lightbox inside another component, say <code>sc___carousel</code>, your markup may look something like this:
</p>
<p>[source lang="xhtml"]
</p>
        <sc___carousel id="carousel1" numVisible="4" isCircular="true" isVertical="false">
            <h___outputLink value="images/boxers/Boxer1.jpg" rel="lightbox[boxers]">
                <h___graphicImage value="images/boxers/tBoxer1.jpg" alt="Good looking dog"/>
            </h:outputLink>
            <h___outputLink value="images/boxers/BoxerFace.jpg" rel="lightbox[boxers]">
                <h___graphicImage value="images/boxers/tBoxerFace.jpg" alt="Only a mother could love that face."/>
            </h:outputLink>
            <h___outputLink value="images/boxers/DogGoat.jpg" rel="lightbox[boxers]">
                <h___graphicImage value="images/boxers/tDogGoat.jpg" alt="Best of friends?"/>
            </h:outputLink>
            <h___outputLink value="images/boxers/boxer-pup.jpg" rel="lightbox[boxers]">
                <h___graphicImage value="images/boxers/tboxer-pup.jpg" alt="In the sandbox"/>
            </h:outputLink>
            <h___outputLink value="images/boxers/boxer-dog.jpg" rel="lightbox[boxers]">
                <h___graphicImage value="images/boxers/tboxer-dog.jpg" alt="Fun-loving dogs"/>
            </h:outputLink>
            <h___outputLink value="images/boxers/stonewall.gif" rel="lightbox[boxers]">
                <h___graphicImage value="images/boxers/tstonewall.gif" alt="Boxers are intelligent and curious"/>
            </h:outputLink>
        </sc___carousel>
        <sc___lightbox id="lightbox1" group="boxers"/>
<p>[/source]
</p>
<p>Notice that we created the carousel as we normally would, but we added the <code>rel</code> attribute to the <code>h:outputLink</code> components, then we create the lightbox and specify the group to use.  The lightbox JavaScript will gather all of the links with <code>rel="lightbox[boxers]"</code> and add them to the image group.  I'm sure you've noticed that the actual image and link construction has to be done manually.  A new component will be added shortly to do that work for you.  I'm still working through how that should look, but as soon as it's ready, I'll let you know here.
</p>
<p>Like <code>sc___imageZoomer</code>, a screen shot wouldn't do this component justice, so please take a look at the <a href="http://demo.steeplesoft.com/mojarra-scales-demo/lightbox.jsf">demo application</a> to see the lightbox in action.
</p>
<p>As a side note, I'd like to point out that this lightbox implementation is 100% custom, YUI-based code.  While the behavior and appearance of the widget was influenced by (read as, lifted from : ), the implementation linked above, I wanted to reduce, as much as possible, the number of external libraries Mojarra Scales ships with, so I wrote this implementation.  I also got the boxer images from Google Images (my wife and I have a Boxer named Sadie, who is our third Boxer, after Bosco and Abby : ). If you stumble across this and find an image of yours that you want removed, please let me know. :)
</p>
<p>As always, if you notice any bugs or deficiencies, or if there's a feature you'd like to see, please feel free to file an <a href="http://kenai.com/jira/browse/SCALES">issue</a>.</p>
