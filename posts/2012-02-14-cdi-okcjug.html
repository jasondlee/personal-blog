<p>I had the opportunity today to present an introduction to CDI at the <a href="http://okcjug.org" title="Oklahoma City Java Users Group">Oklahoma City Java Users Group</a>.  It was a smaller crowd, but they had great questions nonetheless.  After a rough start in a workspace that wasn't quite as clean as it should have been, I think the went fairly well. <em>I</em> had a good time at least. : )
</p>
<p>Thanks to all those that came out and asked questions during and after.  If you'd like to play with the code (WARNING: for those of that weren't there, these examples are 100% creativity free : ), you can download the project <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/okcjug_cdi_demo.tar.gz">here</a>.</p>
