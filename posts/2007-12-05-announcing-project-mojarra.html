<p>It is with a pretty high degree of excitement that we, the <strike>JSF RI</strike> Mojarra development team, announce Project Mojarra.  While the project itself is not new (it's the same, high quality and stable JSF implementation we're all familiar with ;), the announcement of the new moniker brings to an end a lengthy, and sometimes frustrating, process of deciding on a name that can pass legal muster.  For more details on the name change, see <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.sun.com/rlubke/entry/project_mojarra_the_jsf_ri">this</a> entry by Ryan Lubke.</p>
