<p>In <a href='/2009/12/new-components-in-mojarra-scales-part-i-sc-datatable/'>Part I</a>, I introduced the new YUI-backed Scales dataTable component.  In this installment in the series, we'll take a look at another new component available in Scales 2.0, <code>sc___autoComplete</code>.<!--more-->
</p>
<p>The auto-complete component is likely very familiar to most seasoned web users.  As information is typed into a field on the form, suggestions are displayed in a box that appears below the input field.  The user is then free to select one of these options or to continue entering his value of choice.  To put such a component on the web page using Mojarra Scales, a component similar to the following can be used:
</p>
<p>[source lang="xml"]
</p>
<sc___autocomplete animate='both' id='autoComplete' suggestions='#{autoCompleteBean.autoCompleteValues}' typeAhead='true' value='#{autoCompleteBean.value}' width='300px'/>
<p>[/source]
</p>
<p>This example will create an input that is 300 pixels wide, has a suggestion box whose appearance is animated in both directions, and allows type ahead -- meaning the component will auto-fill the field with the first result, allowing the user to tab away to automatically select that value or continue typing.  The <code>ValueExpression</code> <code>suggestions</code> is what the component uses to retrieve the appropriate set of suggestions.  In our simple example, the implementation looks like this:
</p>
<p>[source lang="java"]
</p>
<p>    public List autoCompleteValues(String query) {
</p>
<p>        List values = new ArrayList();
</p>
<p>        for (String word : words) {
</p>
<p>            if (word.startsWith(query)) {
</p>
<p>                values.add(word);
</p>
<p>            }
</p>
<p>        }
</p>
<p>        return values;
</p>
<p>    }
</p>
<p>[/source]
</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the bean, we have a static <code>String[]</code> with all of the possible values.  We then iterate over this list, finding words that start with the value the user has entered.  For each hit, we that to a <code>List</code>, which we then return to the client.  It's probably not the most efficient implementation, but should serve to demonstrate the use.
</p>
<p>On the page, this component will look something like this:
</p>
<div style='width: 308px; margin: auto'><a href='http://blogs.steeplesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/autocomplete.png'><img alt='' class='aligncenter size-full wp-image-584' height='293' src='http://blogs.steeplesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/autocomplete.png' title='autocomplete' width='308'/></a></div>
<p>In the next installment, we'll take a look at two image components, <code>sc___imageZoomer</code> and <code>sc___lightbox</code>.  Until then, please feel free to experiment with <code>sc___autoComplete</code>.  If you notice any bugs or deficiencies, or if there's a feature you'd like to see, please feel free to file an <a href='http://kenai.com/jira/browse/SCALES'>issue</a>.</p>
