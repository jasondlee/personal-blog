<p>I recently blogged about a change we made in GlassFish 3.1.2 with regard to REST security.  Specifically, we added some CSRF protection (you can read the details <a href="/2012/03/glassfish-3-1-2-and-rest-security/">here</a>).  For those of you using the Jersey Client, updating your code to support this change is very simple:
</p>
<p>[java]import com.sun.jersey.api.client.filter.CsrfProtectionFilter;
</p>
<p>// ...
</p>
<p>Client client = new Client();
</p>
<p>client.addFilter(new CsrfProtectionFilter());
</p>
<p>// ...[/java]
</p>
<p>On the client side, that's all you have to change.  Jersey will take care of the details.
