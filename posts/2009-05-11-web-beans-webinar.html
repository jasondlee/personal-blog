<del datetime="2009-05-11T21:06:48+00:00">Tomorrow</del><strong> On May 19th</strong>, Pete Muir, JSF 2.0 Expert Group member and Web Beans implementation lead (if I recall correctly) will be leading, in conjunction with <a target="_blank" href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/TheAquarium/JCDI+-+JSR299">The Aquarium</a>, a <a target="_blank" href="http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/WebinarOnJSR299ContextsAndDependencyInjection">webinar</a> covering the forthcoming Java Contexts and Dependency Injection JSR (JSR-299, formerly known by the JSR's former name, Web Beans).  <del datetime="2009-05-11T21:06:48+00:00">Unfortunately, that's right in the middle of the Oklahoma City JUG's meeting, so I can't make it, especially since I'm this month's speaker.  For those of you that won't be attending the OKC JUG tomorrow, this should be a good session on a great spec.  I hope to catch the recording.  Not as good as attending live, but it's all I'll be able to manage.</del>
<p>Dan Allen was nice enough to point out that I misread the announcement, which means OKC people can hear me talk AND attend this webinar.  Win win! (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/">win</a>! ; )</p>
