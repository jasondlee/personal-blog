<p>While we're making product announcements, I might as well mention that NetBeans 6.8 is available today as well.  I really think NetBeans is the best Free <del>Java</del> multi-language IDE on the market.  It's by no means perfect, but I like it a lot.<sup>1</sup>  Quoting from the release:<!--more-->
</p>
<blockquote>Today Sun and the NetBeans(TM) community are announcing the availability of the NetBeans Integrated Development Environment (IDE) 6.8 -- in conjunction with the availability of Java(TM) Platform Enterprise Edition 6 (Java EE 6) and Sun GlassFish(TM) Enterprise Server v3. The NetBeans 6.8 IDE is the first IDE to provide complete support for Java EE 6 and GlassFish v3, and offers other new and exciting features. 
<p>The NetBeans IDE 6.8 is available for download free of charge at www.netbeans.org.
</p>
<strong>KEY UPDATES TO THE NETBEANS 6.8 IDE</strong>
<strong>Complete Java EE 6 Support</strong>: Java EE 6 language features simplify Java application development with less XML configuration, more annotations and more POJO-like development.
<strong>GlassFish v3 Support</strong>: Developers can easily target and deploy to GlassFish v3, including the new lightweight GlassFish v3 Web Profile.
<strong>JavaFX(TM)</strong>: The latest version of the NetBeans editor provides improved code completion, hints and navigation for JavaFX.
<strong>PHP Support</strong>: The NetBeans IDE expands its support of dynamic languages with support for PHP 5.3 and the Symfony framework.
<strong>
<p>Tighter Integration with Project Kenai</strong>: Project Kenai, a collaborative environment for hosting open source projects, now delivers full support for JIRA and improved instant messenger and issue tracker integration. For more information visit <a href="http://www.kenai.com">www.kenai.com</a>.
</p>
<strong>C/C++ Profiling</strong>: The new Microstate Accounting indicator and I/O usage monitor help developers profile and tune C/C++ applications.
<strong>NetBeans Platform</strong>: As a rock-solid application framework for Swing applications, the platform saves developers a huge amount of time and effort by providing commonly-used facilities such as menu items, toolbar items, keyboard shortcuts, and window management out of the box.

<sup>1</sup> Some might expect that, as a Sun employee, I <em>have</em> to push NetBeans, but that's not the case.  I converted from Eclipse months prior to the start of my employment at Sun, so that has no bearing at all on my choice. :)  In fact, I've never had anyone at Sun tell me what to use.  We have engineers that use every major IDE (or none).
